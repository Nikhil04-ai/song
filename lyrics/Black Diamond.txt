[Intro]
Where are you? I love you
Where are you? I love you
Where are you to keep me warm?
[Verse 1]
I had a dream of a place far away
I followed a river where the dead man would play
And I'm leaving in the morning
And I'm leaving in the morning
[Chorus 1]
And I won't die, so don't cry, I'll be home
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea
[Verse 2]
I knew a man, who was tall as the sky
Followed a river where thousands had died
And he was leaving in the morning
Oh no, he was leaving in the morning
[Chorus 2]
Said, if I come home and my woman has flown
Oh, big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say goodbye to 
auld lang syne
Say goodbye to auld lang syne
Say goodbye to auld lang syne
