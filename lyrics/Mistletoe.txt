[Intro]
(
Let's go
)
[Verse 1]
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreadin' so much cheer
I should be playin' in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop starin' at your face
I should be playin' in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
[Chorus]
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Shawty, with you (
Yeah, you know?
)
(With you) Under the mistletoe
[Verse 2]
Everyone's gatherin' around the fire
Chestnuts roastin' like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street, Santa's comin' tonight
Reindeers flyin' through the sky so high
I should be makin' a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Under the mistletoe (
Yeah
)
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Shawty, with you (Oh)
(With you) Under the mistletoe
[Bridge]
Hey, love
The wise men followed a star (The wise men followed a star)
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Hey, love (Hey, love)
Don't you buy me nothin' (Don't you buy me nothin')
'Cause I am feelin' one thing
Your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry Christmas
[Verse 1]
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreadin' so much cheer
I should be playin' in the winter snow (I know)
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop starin' at your face
I should be playin' in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

[Chorus]
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Under the mistletoe (Yeah)
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Shawty, with you (Oh, yeah)
(With you) Under the mistletoe (Under the mistletoe)
[Outro]
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe (Kiss me underneath the mistletoe)
Show me, baby, that you love me so (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Yeah)
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe (Kiss me under the mistletoe)
Show me, baby, that you love me so (Oh, woah)
Oh, oh, oh (Oh, woah, mm-mm-mm-mm)
