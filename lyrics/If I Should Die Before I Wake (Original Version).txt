Title: If I Should Die Before I Wake (Original Version)
Artist: The Notorious B.I.G.
[Intro]
Fuck her, never knew her
Screw her, dump her body in the sewer
Our father, uh-huh
[Verse]
What you expected from his next of kin? (Yeah)
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedrooms, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
Uh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin', the same motherfuckin' question
How many shots does it take (What?)
To make my heart stop and my body start to shake?
If I should die before I wake
[Outro]
All I want is dough and big booty hoes, ya know?
All I want is dough, big booty hoes, ya know? (Money hoes and clothes)
Funk flow, oh (Blunt smoke coming out the nose is all a nigga knows)
All I want is hoes, you know? Dough, flow (Money hoes and clothes)
All I want is dough and big booty hoes, ya know? (Big booty hoes)
All I want is dough, big booty hoes, ya know?
(Money hoes and clothes is all a nigga knows, uh)
Ain't no more verses! The fuck, y'all niggas?
Got shit rocking like I'm 'bout to just drop some new shit
A bastard child at the age of 16, get the game, yeah, man!
