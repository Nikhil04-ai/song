Title: Overload
Artist: John Legend
[Verse 1: John Legend]
Yeah we used to flirt with freedom
'Fore everybody knew our name
We became their favorite secret
Love for love and not for fame
Oh when I was your user your FaceTime abuser
Dose after dose 'til we crashed
Now they bet on our game, say we'll go down in flames
It's too good but we never could last
[Chorus: John Legend 
 & Miguel
]
But oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
But oh, chained our love together, 
never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload, 
love, love...
Don't we always make a show of love 
, love, love, love, yeah...
[Verse 2: Miguel]
Let that cellphone ring, let that bluebird sing, let that message say unread
Let them talk about us, let them talk too much
While we rule the whole world from our bed
[Chorus: Miguel 
 & John Legend
]
'Cause oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
Oh, chained our life together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?

[Bridge: John Legend]
Oh yeah, yeah
[Chorus: John Legend
 & Miguel
]
'Cause oh, we was undercover 'til it overflowed, over exposed
Oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
And now we know, life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?
