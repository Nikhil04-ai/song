Title: my fault
Artist: Ariana Grande
[Verse]
A new day, another leaves
And I wonder why, I'm thinking "Is it me?"
Yeah, and you take the best of me (Mmm)
But you don't believe that I'm not how I seem (Mmm)
[Pre-Chorus]
For how long can I, long can I wait?
I carry on, but you can't relate
You holdin' on to all of this pain
But I'm tired of hurting, I need somethin' safe, yeah
I'm standin' here, you push me away (Ah-ah)
How much can I give before I break?
I worked too hard on me and my brain (Ah-ah)
To not choose the sun and be standin' in the rain
[Chorus]
This can't be my fault
But you make me feel I'm smaller when I'm not
Said, this can't be my fault
But you walk around like you're some kinda god
Yeah, yeah
