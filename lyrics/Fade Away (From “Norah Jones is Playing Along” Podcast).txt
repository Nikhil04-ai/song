Title: Fade Away (From “Norah Jones is Playing Along” Podcast)
Artist: Norah Jones 
[Intro: Logic]
Yo, this is a vibe
You can't hear this
Oh
Alright, let's just, I'll just do these raps
Hey, it's charging
[Verse 1: Logic]
Uh, I been there, I done that, done that, this rap shit, I run that
Motherfucker, this far from a comeback, if one of us fall, then we run back
Can't let that social worker just snatch up my king, gotta get my son back
'Cause when they comin' through, that system don't give a damn about you, you
Everybody gonna die, gonna go one day, maybe it'll happen on a Monday
Uh, driving to work and get hit by a Hyundai, fuck it, let it all go one day
I know, I'ma get it like this, living that life while they all reminisce
Never regrеtted, the second I said it, I feel likе I'm smarter, I read it on Reddit
You're fucking pathetic, my etiquette murder your predicate, bitch, I'm ahead of it, yeah
Yes, I'ma die but I don't wonder why in the hell I'ma ride in the dead of it, yeah
I know, know, life on Earth is so unpredictable
Okay-kay, hold up, let me say, yes, I'll fade away
[Chorus: Norah Jones]
Ooh, fade away
Fade away
Oh, fade away

[
Verse 2: Logic
]
Yeah, uh, uh, okay, alright
Tell me what I wouldn't wanna give for a life like this, arm and a leg quite like this
Fuck around, wanna fight like this, take a hike like this
I might just, might just, I don't know
Make sure that's my intention
Want so much more than this third dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture
No metaphor, I'm being real with you
But it will hit you like, "Goddamn"
Go ahead, follow all of them
Spaceship, I'm in another system
So futuristic, on another mission
Uh, on another mission
On another mission, this intuition
I got it and it's switchin' now, it's off the top
Off the top of that dome
And I'm going home and I'm doin' my thing
And I'm lovin' my boy, I'm lovin' my wife
I'm lovin' my life, I'm lovin' the things that I'm seein'
I'm tryna do me and bein' the best that I can
'Cause I'm the man in this world tryin' to do what I can
So bring it back, bring it back, we bring it back, bring it, bring it back
[Chorus: Norah Jones]
Oh, don't you fade away
Fade away
Fade away
Don't you fade away
