[Intro: Birdman & 
Lil Wayne
]
Yeah, shawty, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout? (
Batman
)
I'm peepin' these niggas out been slippin', look like they ain't 'bout money no more, man, so, uh
Fuck, you know what we gon' do, huh? What we been doin', huh, nigga?
We gon' load up, get a lot more, get a lot more, and say fuck 'em, nigga (
Y-yeah
)
Keep buyin' shit, keep fuckin' hoes, loadin' up on more bitches
Then, you know what I'm sayin'? We gon' get greedy too, nigga
I ain't never gettin' full
I'm full-blooded with this grind (
I got it, I got it
)
Yeah, holla at them, lil' nigga
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & 
Birdman
]
Murder capital, only key to survive is kill (
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
)
If the elements don't murder you, the riders will, for real (
Ah, yeah
)
And niggas know I go hard to the fullest (
Uh-huh
)
Get involved and I got 'em playin' dodgeball with bullets (
Ah-ah
)
Yeah, I got the sawed-off fully (
Come on, shawty
)
In the Sean John hoodie, get fucked, you play pussy (
Pussy-ass nigga
)
Hah, we hit 'em up while they ain't lookin'
And the body shots hurt, but the headshots took him (
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, boy
)
Damn, and if the red dot spot 'em
Then the hollow head got 'em (
We been doin' this shit too, nigga
)
Knock his top to his bottom, jack (
Uptown's finest, bitch
)
Yeah, you see, we grind from the bottom (
CMR, nigga
)
Just to make it to the bottom
At the very bottom of the map (
Tell 'em about it, nigga
)
Lil Weezyana, piranhas everywhere you at (
Ah
)
You gotta wear your extra condom and an extra gat (
Ain't nothin', this that dope, nigga
)
Your bitch can get it for actin' like a man (
You under-dig?
)
And niggas in Pakistan ain't packin' like your man (
We almost ran 'em like that, daddyo
)
I backwards-hand your man on command (
Come on, man
)
In front of niggas he cool with, them boys on fan (
Fredo-ass nigga, shawty
)
I'm on hot, I adjust in different climates
Duckin' the animal keeper, runnin' with my primates (
Yeah
)
You ain't did it 'til you done it like in five states
Weezy hustle, no blubber, I put on weight
And in the drought, I go on a diet and stretch more
Lose all that weight, leave a nigga with stretch marks (
I see you, nigga
)
You don't even come up to a nigga chest, paw
Subpar, what the fuck they play that in the club for?
Real shit, I'm duckin' bombs from a drug war (
Ah
)
No religion, but the cops swear that I'm a drug lord
Father forgive 'em, for they know not who they pushin', Lord (
Yeah, yeah
)
Father, forgive me if I have to send 'em to you, Lord
I'm just tryna dodge the shots they send to the god
They ridin' up highway to heaven boulevard (
Fuck 'em then, shawty
)
Damn, them niggas pussy and jive
Not even in an eye exam, they ain't lookin' for I (
Believe it
)
The A and the K'll make your face crook to the side
Now when you smilin', everybody gotta look from the side
'Cause when you wildin', you ain't lookin', you just lookin' high
And when we hungry, you look like pie
Sweet-potato-ass nigga, you lemon meringue, apple custard
Cherry jelly, don't make me get the biscuit, buster, yeah (
Sweet-ass, pussy-ass, jive-ass motherfucker
)
What up, Gizzle? You my distant brother (
Holla, lil' young nigga
)
Real shit, nigga, same father, different mothers, yeah (
Okay
)
I skip the frontin' and stick to keepin' it trill (
Fuck 'em, shawty
)
You not know me for nothin' other
I'm somethin' other than people, you feel?
I'm deeper, for real
I'm deeper than skills, my speeches can kill
Rest in peace

[Interlude: Birdman & 
Lil Wayne
]
Yeah, you under-dig, shawty? It's all about one thing, nigga
If you 'bout money, nigga, come fuck with us (
Y-yeah
)
If you ain't 'bout no money, get the fuck from 'round us, nigga
And whatever you 'bout, we 'bout it
However you wan' get it, we can give it to you, nigga (
Y-yeah
)
Order, bitch
You under-dig? Put your prints in, nigga
Put your feet down and your nuts on the concrete and let's roll, holla (
Let me get it back, ayy, ayy
)
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & 
Birdman
]
You sleep in the field for trying the dude
I'll bust your head to the meat (
Yeah
), turn your mind to food (
Okay
)
Food for thought, think I ain't lyin' to you (
Okay, shawty
)
I lie his body in grease, set fire to him (
Fuck him, burn him
)
I tie his body in sheets, put the tires to him (
Burn him, drown him
)
Make him feel the Escalade, put his feet in the blades (
Ah
)
Damn, I'm the heat in the blaze
And niggas keep they ways when I'm in the streets with Blake, why?
My nigga hungry, he'll eat the plate
And if I ask, the homeboy'll eat your face, yeah (
Okay
)
And though he got me, you can ask (
Yeah
)
I'm like a pool table, I keep the eight, haha (
Eight
)
My side pocket sideways
When I pop it, leave a nigga sideways for five days
Birdman, talk to 'em

[Interlude: Birdman & 
Lil Wayne
]
Yeah, nigga, I'll tell 'em, I'll tell 'em again, shawty
If it ain't 'bout no money, get the motherfuck from 'round me nigga (
Fuck that, I'm comin' back in, ayy, ayy
)
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & 
Birdman
]
Check my swag, I travel like sound, dog
You play hard and I'm gravel like ground, dog (
Come on, nigga
)
I'm underground, call me groundhog (
Yeah
)
Lay down laws, call me ground-law (
Give it to 'em, shawty, fuck 'em
)
Don't confuse me with the law, nah
But just confuse me with my pa
Because I am the Birdman J.R. (
Brr
)
I ain't trippin' nigga,
 
I play the corner like Ripken, nigga
With the 40-Cal Ripken, nigga, rip a nigga (
Ah
)
Flip your vehicle, split your windshield
Whack your baby mama, but I'll let the kid live
And people say that I am a kid still
'Cause the lil' nigga still ride on big wheels
You feelin' animal, then come on and get killed (
Yeah
)
The SIG peel bandannas like bananas (
Yeah
)
Say I'm slight bananas I blow a weekend in Havana
In my cabana with my bottom bitch from Savannah (
Yeah, shawty
)
Man, a train couldn't stop your man (
Ah
)
I man up, and you not a man
I stand up, say, "I got my land"
I'm the man of my land, call it Lil-Weezy-ana
That's the new plan, that's the

[Outro: Birdman]
Yeah, nigga
You 'bout some money? Get at me, nigga
That's the only way
Dumb shit, we 'bout that, get at me
You under-dig?
Nigga roll solo
Dolo, nigga
