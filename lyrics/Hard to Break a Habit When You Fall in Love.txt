Title: Hard to Break a Habit When You Fall in Love
Artist: Crush
[Verse]
Lately my decision-making has been tragic
Make a wrong move, the consequences can be drastic
I pray it jam in traffic, make it to the back nine
Cruel world, even your mama could get flatlined
Nobody care until it's too late
Family crying, baby boy hung himself with his own shoelace
I know it take a lot to escape the weight of the world
So I don't judge on the intake of drugs
Hard to break a habit when you fall in love
I been tryna get it right, but I been fuckin' up
Baby, could you tell me that I'm strong enough?
I wanna be the one for you, but I been in a rut, yeah
Be Baby Bone's backbone as you get your back blown
In the two-tone Porsche with the roof gone
Then have an argument and send me to the futon
Been gettin' money, you rappers still using coupons
Been spittin' flows and blockin' bitches like Buffon
Sold-out shows, so come in and get your groove on
Not even thirty, but I've been doing this too long
That's how it feels when you change the whole scene
Way before your prime, barely crackin' seventeen
Used to wanna be an artist, now they just wanna be seen
By any means, teens walk around like crack fiends
Gettin' high off, like, views and streams
I been a victim of these same dreams
The highs, the lows, everything in between
Only I can decide what my life could be
'Cause who else is gonna fight for me?
In a world where nobody livin' righteously, yeah
I gotta do what's right for me
Forgive me for my wrongdoing, I get high
Play with my life like I'm rolling dice
Poke my vein, hoping that the pain will subside
Whatever floats your boat, whatever finds your lost remote, yeah
Whatever kicks you into overdrive
Do what you gotta do to stay alive
Whatever happened with the passion within you and I?
Just what I think about when I lay down
Dogs in the backyard runnin' around
Baby mama holdin' me down with no drama
Dreams, I'm hopin' to live out and outlive my bad karma
Yeah, I hope I live past my regrets
And I'm able to get everything off my chest
I hope the money was worth the investment
The music is my testament
For the pain and suffering through the fame
As my memories begin to fade
And the energy around me don't feel the same
On the phone with Jahseh a few days before he got slain
Wish I could remember every word he said that day
But those days, my mind was so foggy
And plus I didn't know that'd be the last time he would call me
A couple weeks before Peep died, he came to my home
Invited me to his show, but I had a cold, so I couldn't go
I said, "I love you, be safe on the road"

[Outro]
Yeah, ayy, ayy, be safe on the road
