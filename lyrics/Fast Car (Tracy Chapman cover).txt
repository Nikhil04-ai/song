Title: Fast Car (Tracy Chapman cover)
Artist: Sam Smith
[Verse 1]
You've got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I've got nothing to prove
[Pre-Chorus]
See my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
Says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My momma went off and left him
She wanted more to life than he could give
Said somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout boy
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
Live in the suburbs
[Pre-Chorus]
You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You've gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone
Be someone, be someone

[Outro]
You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You've gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Leave tonight or live and die this way
