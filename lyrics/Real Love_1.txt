4am, I left behind
Maybe the love of my life
I know it wasn't right
I know it wasn't even right
Found [?] again
I know that it's over now
But I can't help but think about
Real love
The kind that makes you sick, the kind that makes you wanna die
Real love
The kind that makes you cry, the kind that makes you wanna get high
Real love
Real real love
Real real love
Real real love
