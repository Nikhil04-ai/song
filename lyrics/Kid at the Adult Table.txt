Normally at the holidays
I get seated at the kids' table with all the babies
Babies?
 
I'm thirteen
And I'm at least thirteen
But this year, the adults asked me to sit at their table
So let's put a napkin on these knees and get all grown-up
[Verse 1: Madison Hu]
At the adult table, they're servin' duck confit
You know it's fancy 'cause those words don't make no sense to me
And we got aunt Nillie, man, her stories are crazy
She talkin' 'bout her... new vacuum?
[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo]
Kids' table, we got candy
Like a giant gingerbread school
And we got Santa swingin' nunchucks
But, sure, your table is cool
[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, DeVore Ledridge, Ethan Wacker & Jake Paul]
Kids' table, kids' table, the place to be
Kids' table, kids' table, don't you agree?
Kids' table, kids' table, the place to be
Kids' table, kids' table, giant TV

[Verse 2: Madison Hu]
Okay, that was kinda better, but it's not a competition
Our table's so high and our forks are real... forky
Also, there's games and there's even, um...
And... ah, this is terrible
[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo]
Kids' table, got hydraulics
It was worth the enormous price
Then we wished on a star
And a snowman came to life
[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, DeVore Ledridge, Ethan Wacker & Jake Paul]
Kids' table, kids' table, the place to be
Kids' table, kids' table, don't you agree?
Kids' table, kids' table, the place to be
Kids' table, kids' table, her name is Brie
[Verse 3: Madison Hu]
Back at the kids' table, where I belong
I'll have to say sorry right after this song
I'm feelin' so good, man, I did the right thing
And the biggest surprise is this snowman can sing
[Outro: Olivia Rodrigo &

Ave Maria
Wow
