Title: Miss Pitiful
Artist: Etta James
They call me Miss Pitiful
Ooh, baby, that's my name now
Hey, they call me Miss Pitiful
That's how I got my fame
Ooh, but nobody seem to understand
What makes a woman feel so blue now
Ooh, they call me Miss, Miss Pitiful
'Cause I lost someone just like you now
Hey, they call me Miss Pitiful
Ooh, I think everybody knows now
Hey, they call me Miss Pitiful
Most every place I go
Ooh, but nobody seems to understand
What makes a woman sing such a sad, sad song now
When you lost everything now, lost everything you had now
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, they call me the pitiful girl now
How, how can I explain to you, baby
When you been so very, very blue?
How can I tell you, tell you about my past, baby?
Ooh, they call me Miss Pitiful
Baby, that's my name now
Hey, they call me Miss Pitiful
That's how I got my fame
Ooh, nobody seems to understand what makes a woman sing such a sad, sad song
When you lost everything now
Everything you had now

Ooh, they call me Miss Pitiful
Ooh, I'm a sad, sad, sad, sad girl now
How can I explain it to you, baby
When I been so sad?
Very blue now
Ooh, I know
