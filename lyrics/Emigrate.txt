Title: Emigrate
Artist: Novo Amor 
[Verse 1]
You lit all in white
You're the coastline
Still dividing everything in sight in two
The floor was a tide
It's all that I want
It's all that I wore in time
[Chorus]
Hardly anything, hardly anything works now
Hardly anything, hardly anything works now
[Verse 2]
You made up for my life, celebrate it
Annotating, everything's implied
It grew, I just couldn't decide
For all that I want, I'm dying to scale its side
[Chorus]
Hardly anything, hardly anything works now
Hardly anything, hardly anything works now
[Outro]
Better wide-awake, better hide
But I'm forgetting where I came from
Better emigrate
, better try
But I've forgotten what I'm made of
