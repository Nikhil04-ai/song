Title: My Funny Valentine
Artist: Frank Sinatra
Â 
[Verse 1]
My funny Valentine
Sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
[Bridge]
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
[Verse 2]
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little Valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day
[Bridge]
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

[Verse 2]
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little Valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day
