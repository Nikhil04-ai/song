Title: Miss Me (Demo)
Artist: Lauv
 
[Verse 1]
I would cut these girls off for you
If you say you wanted me too
I don't know what's changed with you
But something's different because
[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you miss me
Then you go and say that you can't kiss me
I don't understand, you're playing with me
Wish I didn't wish that you were with me
But I do, yeah
[Chorus]
You could break my heart and I'd still come back to you, oh
You could change your mind and I'd still wait here for you, oh
And I hate the fact that all these things are true
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
And how long will it take to think of what you're gonna say?
It's been a couple of days, I haven't heard from you
Was it something I said that made you get inside your head?
Girl, you're messing my head and now it hurts when
[Pre-Chorus]
You say you miss me
Then you go and say that you can't kiss me
I don't understand, you're playing with me
Wish I didn't wish that you were with me
But I do, yeah

[Chorus]
You could break my heart and I'd still come back to you, oh
You could change your mind and I'd still wait here for you, oh
And I hate the fact that all these things are true
Oh, oh, oh, oh
