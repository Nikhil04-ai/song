Uh
"Take a sip"
Whaaat? Uh
[Verse]
I know you're thinkin', "Well, goddamn, what he drinkin'?
The crooked letter, no other beer feel better
I used to be a hustler, now I'm a twenty-two brew guzzler
Other beers, I'm not lovin' ya
Forget the great taste that's less fillin'
I'd rather have some Ides and some dimes in the crib chillin'
Or in the six relaxin', honeys in the back
Crackin' six-packs, rubbin' my back
"
Big Poppa
, you all that" - that's what they whisper
"Hey mister, do you have the beer with the eye on the twister?"
He points to the freezer, me bein' a playa
Big Poppa, show stoppa, throw ya cans in the air!
From Bed-Stuy to Van Nuys
St. Ides make eyes droop like Chinese, so why try these?
Other beers just don't pass the test
S-T dot I-D-E to the S
And I'm out!
