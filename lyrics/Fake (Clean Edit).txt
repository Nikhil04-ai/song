Title: Fake (Clean Edit)
Artist: Lauv
[Verse 1: Lauv]
Yeah
You and your friends, you live on the surface
Act like you're perfect, everyone knows
You're just like everyone else
Except for you're better at taking photos
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Why you gotta make everything a show?
[Chorus: Lauv & Conan Gray, Lauv]
Baby, you're so fake, ah
You don't mean a single thing you say, ah
If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah
And you're just like all the people that you hate
You're so fakе
When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phonе
[Verse 2: Conan Gray, Lauv & Conan Gray]
Calling me up when you're getting drunk
You say you're in love, but what do you mean?
'Cause when you wake up, you blame it on drugs
And then we break up, you lie through your teeth
You just wanna play little games for attention
(You just wanna play little games for attention)
Telling me your perfect lies and wasting all my time

[Chorus: Lauv & Conan Gray, Lauv]
'Baby you're so fake, ah
You don't mean a single thing you say, ah
If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah
And you're just like all the people that you hate
You're so fake
When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phone
[Bridge: Conan Gray, Lauv, Lauv & Conan Gray]
You just wanna play little games for attention
(You just wanna play little games for attention)
Pushing me away so I crave your affection
(Pushing me away so I crave your affection)
Calling me insane, but you stay in my mentions
(Calling me insane, but you stay in my mentions)
Telling me your perfect lies and wasting all my time
[Chorus: Lauv & Conan Gray, Lauv & Conan Gray]
Baby you're so fake, ah
You don't mean a single thing you say, ah (Oh)
If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah (Oh)
And you're just like all the people that you hate
You're so fake (Woo)
When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phone
