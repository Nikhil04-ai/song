[Verse 1]
Crying up above, I'm just here to take you away
(You away, you away)
Don't worry 'bout a thing, I'm just focused on you today
(You today, yeah, oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
You're laid out, you were raised up in a poor town
Roll up, baby, roll up
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now
Paris and London (On top of the world)
Baby, we're so down (Will you be my girl?)
Something I wanna say
Yeah, you know I'll be there
[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
[Verse 2]
I see my phone ring, hope it's you, babe
You sent me a picture
Well, I sent one too
I'm just tryna keep this love on track
Oh babe, I got your heart and I won't give it back

[Pre-Chorus]
You're laid out, you were raised up in a poor town
Roll up, baby, roll up
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now
Paris and London (On top of the world)
Baby, we're so down (Will you be my girl?)
Something I wanna say
Yeah, you know I'll be there
[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
[Bridge]
Holding you close to my heart, uh, yeah
So I'm laid back in the Maybach
Damn, these seats go way back
I was thinking about way back
When we used to say that
I was yours, you were mine
And we fought to pass the time
And I realized, I realized, that we
(Babe) No matter what
(Babe) No matter what
(Babe) No matter what (Oh)
Babe, babe, babe, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close, babe, close to my heart
