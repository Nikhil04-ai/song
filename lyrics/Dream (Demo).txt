Title: Dream (Demo)
Artist: Lauv
[Verse 1]
Love is a dream, they try to sell you in magazines
But you never really know what it means 'til you're with someone
Life, is a wave
Sometimes you get carried away
You never wished that you would've stayed 'til you miss someone
I've been, trying to love with my heart half opened
Tell me you'll meet me halfway
I've been alone, baby I've been broken
I was just hoping you'd
[Chorus]
Stay by the wave
All this thinking gets in the way
If we said things that wе don't mean to say, then we'll hurt somеone
Be, let it be
We don't need to rush you and me
We'll go nowhere fast if we speeding, no that ain't for us
Trying to love with my heart half opened
Tell me you'll meet me halfway
I've been alone, baby I've been broken
I was just hoping you'd
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Trying to love with my heart half opened
Whole lot of me in the way
I've been alone, and afraid, and broken
I was just hoping you'd
