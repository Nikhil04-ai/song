Title: Be Mine
Artist: Etta James
Be my love
Be my heart
Be my own
So we never, ever part
Be my all in all
My everything
Be the one wild boy who can make me sing
Be my love, my heart
In the ol' time, but
Darling, be mine
Be a kiss, ooh
Night and day
Be a smile that
Will always stay
Be a devil with the lord in your eyes
Set my heart on fire, ooh, it's paradise
Be a smile, a kiss
In the ol' time, but darling
Be mine
Just sitting here thinking of the sweet little things
Ooh, that I'd want to be
Don't mind, can't see, don't care what you be
As long as you belong to me
Be my love
Be my heart
Be my own, so we never, ever part
Be my all in all, my everything
Be the one wild boy who can make me sing
Be my love, my heart in the ol' time, but
Darling, be mine
Just sitting here thinkin' of all the sweet little things
Ooh, that I'd want to be
Don't mind, can't see, I don't care what you be
As long as you belong to me
Be my love
Be my heart
Be my own
So we never, ever part
Be my all in all, my everything
Be the one wild boy who can make me sing
Be my love, my heart in the ol' time but
Darling, be mine
Ooh, but
Darling, be mine
