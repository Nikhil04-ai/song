Title: Drawing Lines
Artist: John Legend
I'm drawing lines from your home to mine
Making up for lost time
Cause there's not that much difference
The end will come, everyone shut down, pageantry, and parade
Stripped of all its significance
[Humming]
Your brothers eyes, were in disguise
As she agonized, trying to live just beside you
When someone finally tells you when
Your final home will lie
You step out, look around, and see if true love's still inside you
[Gospel Singing]
I'm not singing much, you don't already know
I just hope I'm giving voice to a song that's worth singing
Melody and harmony can electrify your soul
Give you all that you need
When the judgement bells are ringing
[Humming]
I'm drawing lines from your home to mine
Making up for lost time
Cause there's not that much difference
