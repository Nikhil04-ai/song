Title: Ol Box Body
Artist: Crush
[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks] (x2)
Ol' Box body bad knees
Miley Cyrus having ass booty cheeks having ass
Instagram ho hold it down
Deep fried weave ass thots
With your crispy ass toes in them knee socks
[Verse 1: Pouya]
Old turkey neck, fat-back having ass
Collard green, neck-bone, chipmunk stanky ass ho
Oh, I can't touch my toes when i bend over lookin' ho
Why you staring at me ho? you old scary lookin' ho
Old feet greased, sex, man-beast lookin' ho
Night-crawling through the city, I'm a feast on a ho
Got a moped and a ho, riding hella slow
Fuck what you know cause' I gotta do me
Miami city, you know where I be
Ol' shitty booty, bubble guts
You run her up, I bust this nut
The dick just leave them in the cut
Baby bone you know whats up
Gimme some head cause' I don't wanna fuck
Bitch and complain and I don't want to fuss
So bacon flippin' cocaine sniffin' finger lickin' cunt
I be in the cut, Mikey be serving the cut
Haters they want to be us
Them old hoes wanna fuck
Shit talkin' twitter stalkin' too scared to run up
Pussy bitch, I do this shit, you ol' booger pickin' ass cunt

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
I say operator, "operator"
The pussy doing numbers like a calculator
She only stopped fucking cause' the Dr. made her
He's said "baby girl, something ain't right"
Every time I shine my light
Between your thighs it;s like a sight to see
I'm talking waterfalls, mountain peaks
Pine tree's, counting sheep
Is what you're gonna do after I split it
Spit on the dick, then sit on the dick
Like you was waiting for the city bus
And it's running late, it's 1:08
That shit's supposed to be here at 12:10
I'm just a male friend, I ain't ya boyfriend
Cause' alot of these bitches is poison
What makes you think you're poised to win?
Pulled a pistol out the coat
I bought this shit at wal-mart
Cock it back and let it crack it's louder than a dog bark
Talk that shit on twitter but you quiet as a dog fart
When I catch you in traffic, I don't leave it at rapping
[Bridge: Sir Michael Rocks and Pouya]
Now everybody saying that he's sweet
And that I should leave him alone (sweet as hell)
Just leave him alone
Ol' spongebob body ass bitch
But I'll still take the dome (I'll take the dome)
I'll take the dome (just give me head)
Just give me head, just give me head
I said, just give me head, just give me head
