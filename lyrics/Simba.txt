[Intro]
Yeah, DJ OnPoint
 (Yeah, 
DJ OnPoint
)
This, this, this what you want
 (Uh, yeah)
Y'all already know what it is, y'all already know how I do
 (
Fayettenam, nigga
)
Had to come fuck with my nigga J. Cole
 (Uh, yeah, you're gonna love it)
The future of this rap shit, the hottest nigga to come out of North Carolina
 (Yeah, Carolina, nigga)
Listen to The Come Up, the mixtape
And you know why his name's OnPoint, 'cause he on point, pussy
 (Yeah, it's for the 'Ville, nigga)
Yeah, uh
[Verse]
Straight out the 'Ville and I made it
, 
like a villain, I'm hated
I see 'em grillin', I ate it, though
Finna blow, inflatable, that's undebatable, uh
I'm givin' niggas food for thought, the flow is catered, yo
I'm never faded, though
Haters wanna see me broke, but me and the dough related, ho
It's like my only son, where I go, he comes
Niggas dumb to be braggin' 'bout that stupid shit
Nah, I don't stunt on niggas, I show 'em how to do this shit
I'm somethin' like the light-skin version of the very same baby
That the Virgin Mary raised
, that's word to everything
Nigga, life a scary game, but I'm playin'
You sucker niggas lie in everything that you're sayin'
Shame on y'all, you tryna ball with the game on pause
A nigga pull the thing on y'all, y'all stain y'all draws
Fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog, I got protection
Lethal weapons and they aim on y'all
, 
I'm like the man on Mars
I'm high as hell
, 
watch me blow like I exhaled
I excel in this rap shit
 'cause y'all spittin' that wack shit
And every nigga suddenly be rappin' 'bout that trap shit
So while you niggas copycat the cats that made classics
I just massacre the streets, I'm a master of the beats
And the rhymes
, I'm rappin' for the freaks and the dimes
And I shine like a motherfuckin' diamond
You shine like a motherfuckin' dime, that's word to my mom
I don't mind if y'all niggas hate
Just know you hatin' on that nigga, nigga, get it straight
I'm spittin' hungry like ain't shit up on my dinner plate
The kind of flow that make a nigga hyperventilate, uh, see, let me demonstrate
I grew up with nothin', it hurt me to see my mother poor
The only pops a nigga ever seen around was Huxtable
And so the muscle flow is somethin' you can't get no muzzle for
Look how the buzz'll grow, 
ballin' 'til the buzzer blow
Man, I'm hungry, does it show? Ain't nothin' funny, fuck a joke
I'm gettin' money 'til my pockets need a tummy tuck
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanently send you to Hell
You meet the devil, sign a permanent lease
Word on the streets is I'm the prince, nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga, young Simba
Word on the streets is I'm the prince, nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga, young Simba
, nigga, yeah

[Outro]
Uh-uh, this for the 'Ville, nigga
Ah-ah, this for them real niggas
Yeah, J. Cole, nigga
It's The, The, The Come Up, nigga, uh
Told y'all niggas we ain't fuckin' around with you, this just the beginning
 (Yeah)
DJ OnPoint, J. Cole
