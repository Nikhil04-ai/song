Title: Soaked
Artist: Muse
Â 
[Intro]
Soaked to the bone
Sink like a stone
Walk home alone
It's not the first time, it's not the worst crime
Your soul will be okay
[Chorus]
When you've had enough
Searching for love
And you miss the touch
Of someone new
[Verse]
Burned by your dreams
It's never how it seems
Cold crushed esteem
Take shelter and hide forever
Your soul will be okay
[Chorus]
And you've had enough
Searching for love
But you miss the touch
Of someone new

Ooooohh
Ooooohh
[Chorus]
And I've had enough
Searching for love
But I miss the touch
Of someone new
[Outro]
Soaked to the bone
Sink like a stone
I will take you home
It's not the first time, it's not the worst crime
Our souls will be okay
