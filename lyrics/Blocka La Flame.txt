Dis type of shit happens every day
All dem I'm under mourn for people pon stay
But none of dem have the guts to pull out and spray
None of them have the guts to pull out and spray

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I got diamonds on my blocka,

Yeah, that's my flocka (Ooh, yeah), to my flocka (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pray to Lord on my shotta, she be proper (Uh, uh)

Fuck, fuck, fuck, might lose your soul for my language
Nowadays's, niggas been at round tables talkin' all that heinous language (Yeah)

Put that money on your head, Balenciaga yarmulke (Yeah)
Fifteen when I carried loads of them Ozium's
And them bag of nicks, I mean, groceries
I mean, daddy knows ain't no controllin' me (Yeah, ye-yeah)
My bad, look Scotty might sag
She give me head before the ass and never let no nigga smash
No puffin', no pass (Yeah)

Get everything that you got
Break me a piece of that off, rest in peace, niggas I lost

[Verse 2]
Oh God, this shit too cold for the mink, Ye

Might buried your ass in that Sphinx, mane (Yeah)
Sip Merlot, watch us make the champagne rain (Yeah)
Let my ding-a-lang hang (Ye-yeah)

We runnin', summers, we runnin', spring and fall, joggin' be nothing
Winter, they cuffin', cuffin' them up as they lovin'
The same month as my niggas stuffin' (Yeah)
Ridin' through, rockin', Shaka Zulu (Yeah)
Block Crip or whole family blue; bloody, yeah, su-woo
Ain't you supposed to preach what you practice?
Put a rubber on if you stabbin'
Get baptized if you baptist, but ain't it evil to live backwards (Yeah)
Holy Ghost, hold on
Chakalu blakalu los: that's tongue for you niggas who lost
[Chorus]
I-I-I-I got diamonds on my blocka, 
serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka (Ooh, yeah), to my flocka (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pray to Lord on my shotta, she be proper (Uh, uh)
Yeah, that's my flocka (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
