Title: Eternally Missed
Artist: Muse
Â 
[Verse]
Chase your dreams away
Glass needles in the hay
The sun forgives the clouds
You are my holy shroud
[Pre-Chorus]
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
No, it doesn't change
[Chorus]
And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel
[Verse]
Chase your dreams away
Glass needles in the hay
The sun forgives the clouds
You are my holy shroud

[Pre-Chorus]
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
No, it doesn't change
[Chorus]
And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
You can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel
And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel

[Outro]
(Chase your dreams away)
(Glass needles in the hay)
(The sun forgives the clouds)
(You are my holy shroud)
