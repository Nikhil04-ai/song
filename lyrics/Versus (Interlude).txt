Title: Versus (Interlude)
Artist: Jay-Z
“Versus” is a quick eight-bar sonning from Hov.
[Verse 1]
Hey, sucka nigga, wherever you are
I thought about you, fool, while I was driving my car
I wonder if you fools realize how far you are
You're nowhere in my rear mirror
[Verse 2]
Your last shit ain't better than my first shit, uh
Your best shit ain't better than my worst shit, uh
The truth in my verses versus
Your metaphors about what your net worth is
[Outro]
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
