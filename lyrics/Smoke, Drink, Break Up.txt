Title: Smoke, Drink, Break Up
Artist: Dua Lipa
[Verse 1]
See, I gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I gotta be outta my head to be still with ya
See, I love you, but I don't like that
I leave, but then I come right back to you
So what is the point? I might as well sit here and roll me a joint
Or pour me a drink
So I can get wasted and don't have to think no more
Get high as a plane
'Cause sober, we drive each other insane
And we know if we don't, we gon' start fightin' again
[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up
[Post-Chorus]
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Let's go

[Verse 2]
I've gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I've gotta be outta my head to be still with ya
See, I love you but I don't like that
Keep leavin', comin' right back to you
So I roll me swisher, pour me some liquor before we start to bicker
And callin' each other out our names like bitches and n-
Arguin' over all that small shit, keeps gettin' bigger
Corona out the kitchen
[Chorus]
Smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up
[Post-Chorus]
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
[Verse 3]
Boy, we only get along when we high, oh yeah
Boy, we only get along when we high
Either we smokin', oh

[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drinkin' or high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up
[Post-Chorus]
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Either we smokin', or we drinkin', or we at each others throat
Leggo
[Outro]
Thug love, thug love, thug love
