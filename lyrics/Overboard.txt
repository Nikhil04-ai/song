Title: Overboard
Artist: Justin Bieber
[Verse 1: Jessica Jarrell]
It feels like we've been out at sea, oh
So back and forth, that's how it seems, oh
And when I wanna talk, you say to me
That if it's meant to be it will be, woah
[Pre-Chorus: Jessica Jarrell]
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Got me out here in the water and I
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm overboard and I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Life saver, oh life saver, oh
My life saver
Life saver, oh life saver, oh
Whoa
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I never understood you when you'd say, oh
You wanted me to meet you halfway, woah
I felt like I was doing my part
You kept thinking you were coming up short
It's funny how things change, cause now I see, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for ya
Got me out here in the water and I
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm overboard and I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Jessica Jarrell]
Oh, it's supposed to be some give and take, I know
But you're only taking and not giving anymore
So what do I do? Cause I still love you
And you're the only one who can save me
Woah, woah, woah
[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jessica Jarrell]
I'm overboard and I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own, it's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
My life saver
Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
Whoa
Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
My life saver
Life saver, oh, life saver, oh
Yeah
