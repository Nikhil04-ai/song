Title: Kilburn Towers
Artist: Bee Gees
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I am a bird, watch me go drifting by
With my feathers of power
I laugh as the hours go slowly by
That could mean everything
[Verse 2]
I am a street, watching the people walk
As I listen, their conversations glisten
As they start to talk
Then I hear everything
[Chorus]
Little white jug, me, and Kilburn Towers
As we sit on the hill and we drink
And we swill 'til the early hours
Then I am everything
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
[Bridge]
That could mean everything
[Chorus]
Little white jug, me, and Kilburn Towers
As we sit on the hill and we drink
And we swill 'til the early hours
Then I am everything
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers

[Outro]
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers...
