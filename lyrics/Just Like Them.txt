Title: Just Like Them
Artist: Justin Bieber
 
[Intro]
I know it’s hard but, you know
Let’s go
[Verse 1]
There’s something different in your eyes baby
You can’t seem to look into mine lately
Tell me what is on your mind baby
Or I'm gon' assume that something’s wrong
[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not really tripping, I just can’t do this again
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them
[Chorus]
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them
You’re just like them
[Verse 2]
I know that it’s hard to trust love
But you need the trust that my love
Will never leave you in the dust
[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely tripping I just can’t do this again
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them

[Chorus]
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them
You’re just like them
[Bridge]
Baby can we keep this love on track?
We can run away baby girl and we don't have to look back
You know that I love you girl so tell me what you’re waiting for?
You gotta know know know know
Know know know know know know
Know know know know know know
[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely tripping I just can’t do this again
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them
[Chorus]
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them
You’re just like them
