Title: Empty Sky
Artist: Elton John
[Verse 1]
I'm not a rat to be spat on, locked up in this room
Those bars that look towards the sun
At night look towards the moon
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings, take me high above
[Chorus]
And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place
[Verse 2]
At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems, oh, so far
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love
[Chorus]
And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, fly!
[Chorus]
And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, yeah

[Verse 3]
Hey, the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man, yeah
[Chorus]
And I looked high and saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place
Fly on
[Outro]
Just send up my love, ain't seen nothing but tears
Now I've got myself in this room for years
I don't see no one, I never see anyone
Anyone, ah yeah
Oh
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Oh-ho-ho
Woo, yeah
I said get down with it, babe
I want you to shh...
Right down now, right down now
Ah...
Oh... get on now
Get on up now
