Title: Never Let Me Go
Artist: Lana Del Rey
[Verse 1]
Hold me in your arms
Love me like your best friends dear
Promise I won't hurt you, kid
Hold me really tight until the stars look big
Never let me go
[Verse 2]
All the world is ours
Like they say in Scarface, kid
You can push your drugs and I can make it big
Singing at CBGB's, have a real good gig
Hey, you never know
[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause, baby, we were born to live fast and die young
Born to be bad, have fun
Honey, you and me can be one
Just believe, come on
[Chorus 1]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

[Verse 3]
We gonna go far
I can already taste it, kid
L.A.'s gonna look real good
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Never let me go
[Verse 4]
Send me to the stars
Tell me when I get there, kid
I can be your Nancy, you can be my Sid
Get into some trouble like our parents did
Hey, they'll never know
[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause baby, we were born to be bad and move on
Built to go fast and stay strong
Honey, you and me, and no one
Just believe, come on
[Chorus 1]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

[Bridge]
I remember when I saw you for the first time
You were laughing, sparkling like a new dime
I came over, "Hello, can you be mine?
Can you be mine? Can you be mine?"
[Chorus 2]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Baby, it's a sweet life, sing it like a song
It's a short trip, only getting one
Can count on you, my love, more than anyone?
Never let me go
[Chorus 1]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay
