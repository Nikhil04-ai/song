Title: Walk In
Artist: Crush
[Verse 1: Pouya]
Mama told me I was a God, "Don't get involved with mortals"
Keep my destiny in order, "When you're older, you will thank me for it
Don't get entangled with petty women who blur your vision
Keep your head steady for the final mission or the bigger picture
It's never you against the world, it's you against the mirror
Keep these thoughts in your mind tight like handcuffs"
Let them label me whatever they want me to be, because
Regardless of my actions, they will always elеct to be a hater
Your daddy was a bitch, your mama was a ho
Your sister want my dick, I think I just might lеt it blow
Fuckboy, don't doubt me
I'm in the flat black Cadillac and I'm slouchin'
Flyin' down the I-95
With a pistol on my hip because you never know why
Or when your time's up
It can get rough in the 305 so you gotta stick and jive
Avoid the petty drama, the prima donnas
The demons of the clout multiplyin' like they sproutin' out the ground
Open your eyes and look around, these hoes are so deceptive
You heard the lyrics in my song, but did you get the message?
They say I rap too fast and never switch my flow
They say they miss my past, the old Baby Bone
Suck it up, bitch, grab a bucket, I'm blessed, but I'm not lucky
I worked for this, I won't remain stagnant and rusty, yeah

[Chorus: Lu baby]
I might just slide
Walk in ready to die
Pain in my chest, no peace on my mind
Walk tall, you can't be denied
[Post-Chorus: Lu baby]
Oh, oh, you can't be denied
Oh, oh
[Verse 2: Lu baby]
I lay low, stroll alone at night
I seek approval and I come up short every time
Make peace with demons, plea for them to free me from my mind
Oh, not so easy, take a seat, get ready for the ride
You are exactly where you should be
Don't trip, baby, life ain't so 2D
I don't need no one to introduce me
Lu baby, I walk in and I do me
Mountains made of metal, valleys made of plastic
Two-faced exchanges, no matches made in Heaven
Bullshit conversation, fake-ass embraces
Fake-ass motherfuckers, they always the strangest, yeah
Hi, hater, how my dick taste from your cubicle?
Doing voodoo in Isuzu, baby got 'em like goo-goo
They be watchin' like, "Who Lu?" They be watchin' like, "Who knew?"
Who knew doing you was a route to the truth, boy?
Boots made of alligator, belt made of Dachshund
Class clown, woke up pissed off so I act out
I walk in, I do me, I check in, I check out
You see me in public, you blessed now, yeah (Amen)

[Chorus: Lu baby]
I might just slide
Walk in ready to die
Pain in my chest, no peace on my mind
Walk tall, you can't be denied
[Post-Chorus: Lu baby]
Oh, oh, you can't be denied (Yeah)
Oh, oh, take off your disguise
Oh, oh, take off your disguise
Mm-mm
