Title: Ol’ 55
Artist: Eagles
 
[Verse 1]
Well, my time went too quickly
I went lickety-splitly out to my ol' 55
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive
[Chorus]
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know the feelings getting stronger
[Verse 2]
Six in the morning, gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Now the cars are all passing me
Trucks are all flashing me
I'm headed home from your place
[Chorus]
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know the feelings getting stronger

[Verse 1]
Well, my time went too quickly
I went lickety-splitly out to my ol' 55
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive
[Outro]
And now the sun's coming up, yes it is
I'm riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck
