[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Open up your mind
And let me step inside
Rest your weary head
And let your heart decide
[Chorus]
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy, all you have
To do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Yeah
[Verse 2]
When you're feeling down
And your resistance is low
Light another cigarette
And let yourself go
[Chorus]
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world, all you have
To do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Ooh, yeah

[Bridge]
My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head
Down to my toes
My love is pumping
Through my veins (play the game)
Driving me insane
(Come, come, come, come)
Come play the game
Play the game, play the game
Play the game
[Guitar Solo]
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
[Chorus]
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world (free world)
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game, yeah
Everybody play the game of love
Your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world (free world)
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
