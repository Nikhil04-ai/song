Title: Cigarettes & Coffee
Artist: Etta James
It's early in the morning, hmm
About a quarter, quarter to three, yeah
I'm sitting here talking with my baby
Over cigarettes and coffee, now, now
And to tell you that
Darling, I've been so, been so satisfied, ah
Honey, since I met you
Oh, baby, baby, since I met you, whoa, ah
All the places that I've been around
And all the good looking boys I've met, yeah
They just don't seem to fit in, no, no
Knowing this is particularly sad, yeah, yeah, yeah
But it seems so natural, darling
That you and I are here
Just talking over cigarettes
And drinking coffee, whoa now
Oh, my heart cries out
Love, at last I've found you, oh, oh, now
And honey, honey, won't you let me
Just be my whole life, be my whole life around you
And while I complete
I complete my whole life
Oh, it would be
Oh, I said it would be, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you would take things
Take things under consideration
And walk down this hour with me, yeah
And I would love it, I would love it, yeah, yeah
People, I say it's so early in the morning, oh
It's a quarter, quarter to three
We're sitting here, we're sitting here, talking
Talking, oh baby, over cigarettes
And cigarettes and drinking coffee, now, now lord
I'll like to show you, well
I've known nothing but good old joy, yeah, now listen
Since I met you, darling, oh, hon'
Honey, since I've met you, baby, baby, yeah, yeah
I would love to have another drink
Of coffee, now baby, now
And please, darling, help me to smoke
This one more cigarette, now
And I don't want no cream and sugar
'Cause I've got you baby, I got you darling
But just let me enjoy, help me to enjoy
This good time, this good time we'll have, baby, yeah

Now listen, it's so early, early in the morning, oh
So early, so early, early in the morning
And I've got you and you've got me and we got each other
And we don't, we don't want nothing but joy
Joy, oh, nothing but joy
I've got you, oh, you've got me
I've got you and you've got me
I've got you and you've got me
And gotta, got
You got me and I got you
And you got me and I got you
You got me and I got you, baby
I got you, babe, I've got you, I've got you, I got you
