Title: Lunch Money
Artist: Pusha T
“Lunch Money” was released accidentally on Google Play due to miscommunication with Pusha & Kanye West. Pusha T posted the cover art for the single on his Instagram page, confirming that it was official.
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fuckin' hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable
[Verse 1]
Mami tryna land a Sinatra
So she don't fuck niggas with Apple Watches (No)
'Cause Rolex shopping is more exciting
Shout-out the dope boy, lift sixteen swipers (Woo)
Howard Homecoming kingpins
Movie on my neck with the screen gems
Me and my nigga havin' bottle wars
Forty thousand on the floor when them bottles pour (Spill, nigga)
I'm Blu-Ray to your DVD
You might've caught me on TMZ
Cameo tryna sue a nigga (Fuck 'em)
'Cause I party hard like it's three of me (Yeah)
America's still abusing us
And 9-11 is the Ku Klux
So why wouldn't I fire back
When every day them niggas shooting us?
True enough, I'm out of line
You better stand for something 'fore you out of time
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, tell me, who am I behind? Ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fuckin' hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable
[Verse 2]
Papi get me everything I want
Riding 'round with Miguel Cotto in the trunk
What I'm cookin' in the kitchen, niggas?
Bobby Brown, New Edition, niggas
What I'm wearing in this blizzard, nigga?
Mink, leather, or it's lizard, nigga
Saint Laurent, I'm in all layers
The mannequin to you ballplayers (
Facts
)
Shoutout my MAC-11 monster
Grew up on Nintendo playing 
Contra
And though that nigga only 5'9"
Hundred bodies on his timeline
What's the price of success?
Uh, lost my bitch, bought a chef (Woo)
The 911 cost 211
Watch looking like a jeweler's heaven
Hottest seven, I'm so alive
Your bank account Swiss, nigga? So is mine
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, tell me, who am I behind? Ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fuckin' hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable
