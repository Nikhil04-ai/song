Title: Just Noise
Artist: Norah Jones 
If you hear my heart breaking
And you don't know what it is
Don't be alarmed, it won't do you no harm
It's just noise, it's just noise
It's just noise, it's just noise
If you notice my hopes falling
As they scatter across the floor
Don't be concerned or startled
It's just noise, it's just noise
It's just noise, it's just noise
And when I'm walking through the city
Looking for where my thoughts have run
Inside there's nothing working
No one knows what I've become
No one knows what I've become
If you hear my wheels turning
And you don't know where I've gone
Don't look outside, don't bother your pride
It's just noise, it's just noise
It's just noise, it's just noise
Don't look outside, don't bother your pride
It's just noise, it's just noise
It's just noise, it's just noise
