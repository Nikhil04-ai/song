Title: Maybe Your Baby
Artist: Stievie Wonder
 
[Verse 1]
I'm feeling down and some kind of lonely
'Cause my baby done left me here
Heart is blazing like a five alarm fire
And I don't even give a care
I feel like the world is turning on me (Yeah...)
My dreams turn to ashes right in front of my face (Oh...)
And I–I'm getting kind of worried
And I 
feel
 so out of place – mhmm
[Chorus]
Maybe your baby done made some other plans (Ooh whoaa)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
[Post-Chorus]
...I feel like cryin'! (Cryin' – yeah!)
(Baby, baby – maybe!) Yeah...
(Baby, baby! Maybe, baby... yeh-oh!)
[Verse 2]
In the morning, when I've got a heartache
I can't call up the doctor for help
'Cause the only person that could ever do me any good
Is stepping out–out with my best friend
I feel like I'm slipping deeper
Slipping deeper into myself
(And...) And I can't take it
This stuff is scaring me to death – I, I...

[Chorus]
Maybe your baby done made some other plans (And you're makin' me worry...)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans (Uhh, yeah-eah...!)
[Post-Chorus]
Ohhh, yeah... yeah, yeah
Yeah... (yeah, yeah... oh!)
Baby!
[Bridge]
Little Sally Walker....
 sitting in a saucer...
Checking out the guys that are passing by...
By, by, by, by... by... by!
Yeah...
[Hook]
Hey...
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(Ohh) (And again...)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(Not includin' a future for me now–oww!)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(Yee-hee-eea) (Yeahhh!)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(Hee-hee) (Ah... baby, baby...)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(Baby, baby... made another plan... with another man, yeah...)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(
Baby! Yo' baby! Stupid baby! Yo' baby – put so much trust in ya, baby
)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(
Oh, baby... your love... baby... put–so much–trust–in yo' baby, ha...
)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(
Baby! Yo' baby! Yo' baby! Yo' baby...! Uh- huh...
)
(
I'm a little boy...
)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(Baby, baby, yo' baby, yo' babe, another, baby, yeah!)

Maybe your baby done made some other plans, uh-huh, uh-hah
Maybe your baby done made some other plans, uh-hah-hah, ah...
Maybe your baby done made some other plans (Ah... yeah! Ohhh, yeah!)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans (Ohhhh, yeah! Ohh, baby!)
Maybe your baby–sit down!–done made some other plans
(Oh, yeah! Ohh, yeah! Ah, face it, you're my baby–ohh, yeah!)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(Ohh, ya hurt me! Oh! Baby... oh, lil' baby)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(Oh! Maybe–she'll come back tomorrow... maybe my baby... ohhhh, my baby, ohhh, yeah!)
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
(
Shit!
