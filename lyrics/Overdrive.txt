Title: Overdrive
Artist: Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
Comin' down, I'm comin' 'round
This time I think I'm wakin' up
Give me loud to drown it out
Before the world starts breakin' up
[Pre-Chorus]
You change and then
You change again
Turnin' like a wheel inside your head
[Verse 2]
Yours and mine and left and right
There's still two sides to everyone
You and I get on with life
And pray we'll find a better one
[Pre-Chorus]
You change and then
You change again
It's turnin' like a wheel inside your head
[Chorus]
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Two strangers on the mend

[Post-Chorus]
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
[Verse 3]
Hurry now, we're gettin' out
This time there's nothing stoppin' us
Leave behind this vacant town
Tonight and let it turn to rust
[Pre-Chorus]
You change and then
You change again
Turnin' like a wheel inside your head
[Chorus]
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Two strangers, no relation, on the mend
[Pre-Chorus]
You change and then
You change again
Turnin' like a wheel inside your head

[Verse 1]
Comin' down, I'm comin' 'round
This time I think I'm wakin' up
Give me loud to drown it out
Before the world starts breakin' up
[Pre-Chorus]
You change and then
You change again
Turnin' like a wheel inside your head
[Chorus]
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Two strangers on the mend
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death (overdrive, we're goin' life or death)
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death (overdrive, we're goin' life or death)
Overdrive, we're goin' life or death
Two strangers, no relation
Two strangers, no relation, on the mend
