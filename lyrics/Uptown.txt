[Intro: Travis Scott]
Uh
Mm
[Chorus: Travis Scott & 
A$AP Ferg
]
I'm ridin' up uptown (Woo)
I'm a motherfuckin' monster (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick
I'm a motherfuckin' monster (Woo)
You ridin' up uptown (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick, uh (
Woo, woo, woo
)
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
At the green light, I'm speedin'
Fourth wheel on, I'm weavin'
I got red eyes and swag seizures
All my concerts fillin' them bleachers
Ooh, girl, with this camo' on, they can't see us
Tossed in a lil' more dank and a lil' more drank than La Flame might need
Tito Puente with the candy top
Fuck around, make the Latinas pop (Mm)
It's a new world order (Mm)
Never had my head on my shoulders, uh
Beware of the monsters
Ain't that what your preacher told ya? (Uh)
La Flame, five hundred degrees
From the uptown to the Magnolia

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I'm a motherfuckin' monster (Woo)
I'm a motherfuckin' monster (Woo)
Uh, I'm ridin' up uptown (Woah)
I'm a motherfuckin' monster (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, damn (Uh, mm)
[Verse 2: Travis Scott & 
A$AP Ferg
]
"Damn, you gorgeous", tell me something I don't know
Dice on the corner with the lights low
Got the base in my sock, fuck the 5-0
Damn, you conscious, gon' get your head off the plate, though
Let me show you lil' Yamamoto, take a lil' lick of the mayo
Out on 135th, spendin' them pesos
Tell my nigga Fergie Ferg, "Keep the back locked", c'ause we got a lil' bit of Tango (
Yeah
)
Real nigga from the South to the East of Philly, nigga
Bangin' wax since a nigga get a wait
, take a little taste
Leave you numb feelin' in the face
I'll pass if that pint ain't sealed, I'll make your weekend hell
XX know that we gon' die for this and probably keep it trill, mm
Chain links, by nigga, popular demand, nigga
My bitch pearls from the clams, nigga
She can ride the dick, no hands, mm
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
While I'm ridin' uptown (Woo, haha, woo)
I'm a motherfuckin' monster (Woo, mm, woo)

[Interlude: A$AP Ferg]
Huh
[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
It's that young Fergenstein (Little Frankenstein)
Pockets full of Benji Franklins, teacher, stay in line
 (Yeah)
Can not take a break, in time, I'll take ya shine
Take your bitch, hit it from the back, I'll break her spine
 (Yeah)
I'm a lady, your bitch look like Shanaynay
 (Yeah)
Margiela so cold, feel like Tommy gettin' his payday
 (Wow)
Goin' nuts like a Payday (Wow), bitches thinkin' I'm crazy
 (Yeah)
My fraternity is the burna heat (Wow), I'm a Kappa nigga with an AK-ay
 (Yeah)
Barkin' loud like Q-Dogs (Woo), movin' niggas like U-Hauls (Woo)
Pussy niggas so RuPaul (Wow), you pussies get me tight like blue balls
(Woo, woo, woo, woah)
[Outro: Travis Scott]
I'm ridin' up uptown
I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'm ridin' up uptown
 (Mm, woo, mm)
Hand on my dick
I'm ridin' up uptown
