Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
[Verse 1: Logic]
Various women, I'm swimmin' in like a shark
Tear the pussy apart, shawty, it's on after dark
, huh
Step to the mic and now I got ya, call me Young Sinatra
The flow is prominent, hella dominant, on time with it
When I'm rhymin' it to the labels itchin' to sign with it
Now check the women I'm bringin' in with these ill synonyms
Softly killin' 'em, in other words, I'm Lauryn Hillin' 'em
, huh
I swear to God, if I could, I'd never turn the page
Livin' the rest of my days on stage
Fuckin' with bitches that never age
I'm so fly that I defy the laws of physics
I ain't think it was possible for a check to have this many digits
Mathematically exquisite, am I cocky? Just a smidgen
, huh
If you want beef, then we can supersize it
Freshman in the game, so they wanna haze me like my name Isaac
I kill the beat and dig a ditch just to fossilize it
To make sure none of you bammers try to reprise it, what
[Chorus: AZ & 
Nas
]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Life's a bitch and then you die
Got rhymes three sixty-five days annual, plus some

[Verse 2: Logic]
I'm workin' a 9-to-5 just to survive, barely staying alive
Hard to stay focused without the drive
See, I bus tables and my homie Castro is a waiter
I can't wait to blow and say, "I told you so, haters"
, ha
Livin' a life of an egotistical pistol gripper isn't a life for me
I'd rather grip mics and undo girls' zippers
But not them ho girls, meet-me-after-the-show girls
Them take-it-slow girls, have-'em-comin'-back-for-mo' girls
 (Aight)

Yeah, mm, uh

[Verse 3: Logic]
Various managers comin' up, talkin' 'bout they got me
But really, they shadier than Slim in a pair of Versaces
I know you see me shinin', been practicin' and grindin'
While they conform to the norm, you'll catch me designin'
A different type of sound
While you was stuck inside the box, huh, I had already been around
Inner peace and happiness, I'm always tryna find it
And I kinda got the feelin' that a woman is behind it
So I'm always chasin' tails, the real-life Sonic
And I'm always spittin' fire, 
half black, half demonic
, huh
Nah, I'm half black and half white
Come on, this sound, it had to come from somewhere, right?
Nah, nah, see, homie, race is not the issue
And if you steppin' to me like it is, I'll dismiss you
The second you listen, the second I got ya
I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

[Chorus: AZ & 
Nas

Life's a bitch and then you die
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Life's a bitch and then you die
Got rhymes three sixty-five days annual, plus some
