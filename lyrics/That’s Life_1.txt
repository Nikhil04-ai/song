Title: That’s Life
Artist: Lady Gaga
[Verse 1]
That's life (
That's life
)
That's what people say
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change their tune
When I'm back on top in June, oh
[Verse 2]
That's life (
That's life
)
Funny as it seems
Some people get their kicks just steppin' on a dream
But I won't let it get me down
'Cause this whole world keeps spinnin' around
[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet
A pawn and a queen
I've been up and down and over and out
But I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race
[Verse 3]
That's life (
That's life
)
I can't deny it
I thought of quittin', but my hеart just won't buy it
If I didn't think it was worth a try
I'd roll up in a big ball and die

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a paupеr
A pawn and a queen
I've been up and down
But I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
[Outro]
That's life (
That's life
)
Oh, I can't deny it (
Life
)
I thought of quittin', but my heart just won't buy it (
Life
)
If I didn't think it was worth a try
I'd roll myself up in a big ball and die
