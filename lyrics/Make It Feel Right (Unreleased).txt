Title: Make It Feel Right (Unreleased)
Artist: Harry styles
I jump into knee deep water
But I’m sinking, somehow
Trouble on every corner
But you’re all I need now
You, you give me something
What it is I just don’t know
But I feel like a time bomb ticking
And without you I might blow
You give me the feeling
You give me a hiding place
Our love is bitter
But I really like the taste
Who said it was easy
Taking it day by day
But always remember
That I’ll love you anyway
You make it feel right
Oh Oh Ooh Oh Oh Ooh
