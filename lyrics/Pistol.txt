Title: Pistol
Artist: Cigarettes After Sex
[Verse 1]
Give me the pistol
Aim it high
I'm out in the desert
Shooting at the sky
Guess I really miss you
And I don't know what else to do
[Verse 2]
Beautiful pictures
That you took of us
Used to hang up there
On your bedroom walls
But you took 'em all down now
And you put 'em into a drawer
[Chorus]
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long
I can't deal with it
You've been on my mind
And I'll waste my time
'Til you lift me off the floor
And love me again

[Verse 3]
I know if I saw you
And we kissed just once
You could be happy
Maybe you'd come back
'Cause I really miss you
Don't know how much more I can take
[Chorus]
You've been on my mind
You'vе been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long
I can't deal with it
You've been on my mind
And I'll wastе my time
'Til you lift me off the floor
And love me again
[Outro]
Oh, yeah
'Til you lift me off the floor
And love me again
Oh, yeah
