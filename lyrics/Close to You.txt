Title: Close to You
Artist: Ariana Grande
[Verse]
If I'm honest, I wasn’t devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we’re getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
(
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
)
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
(
Just like me
)
They long to be close to you
