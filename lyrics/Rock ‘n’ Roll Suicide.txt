Title: Rock ‘n’ Roll Suicide
Artist: David Bowie
 
[Verse 1]
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger
Then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling
It lingers, then you forget
[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
[Verse 2]
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past the café, but you don't eat
When you've lived too long
[Refrain]
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
[Verse 3]
Chev's brakes are snarling
As you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
They're so natural, religiously unkind

[Bridge]
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
[Outro]
Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (wonderful)
Give me your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Just give your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Oh, give me your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Oh, give me your hands
