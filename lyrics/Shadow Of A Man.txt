Title: Shadow Of A Man
Artist: Lady Gaga
[Intro]
(Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow)
(Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow of a man)
(Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow)
Dance in the shadow of a mâ€”
[Verse 1]
Standing in the shadow of another man
Lonely as the streets pass me by (Oh, oh)
Life ain't under pressure 'cause I got a plan
Starin' at myself in the eye (Oh, oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
When I get this feelin'
I can't get enough
'Cause I start believin'
And my voice gets tough
Now I got this feelin'
I can't get enough
'Cause I won't be used for my love and left out to cry
[Chorus]
I don't wanna fade into the darkness tonight
Show me the light
I don't wanna be the one to fall on the knife
To come alive
I'm about to be there, I'm about to be there
Watch me, I swear
I'll dance in the shadow of a man

[Verse 2]
Hard to be the yellow in a purple sky (Sky)
Peekin' through the eye of the storm (Eye of the storm)
Gotta be the truth or you'll become a lie (Become a lie)
Piercing like your skin from a thorn (Oh, oh, I)
[Pre-Chorus]
When I get this feelin'
I can't get enough
'Cause I start believin'
And my voice gets tough
Now I got this feelin'
I can't get enough
'Cause I won't be used for my love and left out to cry
[Chorus]
I don't wanna fade into the darkness tonight
Show me the light
I don't wanna be the one to fall on the knife
To come alive
I'm about to be there, I'm about to be there
Watch me, I swear
I'll dance in the shadow of a man
[Post-Chorus]
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow (Shadow of a man)
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow of a man
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow (Shadow of a man)
Dance in the shadow of a man

[Bridge]
Can't ignore the voice within
And a woman can't lose, but you still pretend
Can't ignore the voice within
And a woman can't lose, but you still pretend
Can't ignore the voice within
And a woman can't lose, but you still pretend
'Cause I won't be used for my love and left out to cry
[Chorus]
I don't wanna fade into the darkness tonight
Show me the light
I don't wanna be the one to fall on the knife
I'm 'bout to come alive
I'm about to be there, I'm about to be there
Watch me, I swear
I'll dance in the shadow of a man
[Post-Chorus]
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow (Shadow of a man)
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow of a man
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow (Shadow of a man)
Dance in the shadow of a man
