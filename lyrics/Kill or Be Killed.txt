Title: Kill or Be Killed
Artist: Muse
 
[Intro]
(Kill or be killed)
[Verse 1]
Cornered, I'm exhausted with fear
Our love and compassion dissolved
And demons have materialised in me
Can't fight them, they're taking control
[Pre-Chorus]
And we've tried, oh, we've tried
So hard to be good
But the world rewards us when we're bad
[Chorus]
Fate is driving me insane
It's forcing me to face
I must kill or be killed
[Post-Chorus]
(Kill or be killed)
[Verse 2]
They've driven a stake right through my hеart
I'm growing so cold and detached

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've triеd, oh, I've tried
So hard to spread love
But she prefers it when I assert control
[Chorus]
Fate has brought us here to face
Our hopes and dreams erased
Either kill or be killed
[Guitar Solo]
[Breakdown]
(Kill or be killed)
(War)
(Kill or be killed)
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Yah-yah-yah-yah-ah-yah
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah
Either kill or be killed
[Chorus]
Fate is driving me insane
It's forcing me to face
I must kill or be killed

[Outro]
(Kill or be killed)
(Kill or be killed)
(Kill or be killed)
(Kill or be)
