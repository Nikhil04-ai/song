Title: If It Hadn’t Been for Love
Artist: Adele
 
[Verse 1]
Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Would've been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
[Hook]
Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul
[Verse 2]
Never would've gone to that side of town
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've took a mind to track him down
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
And put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

[Hook]
Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul
[Verse 3]
Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
[Outro]
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
