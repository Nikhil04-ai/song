Title: Dance on the Moon
Artist: Travis Scott 
Â 
[Intro: Theophilus London]
Where the weather is warm
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home, wasn't working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can't wait
In the moonlight, you can't see my eyes
And when I'm off the things I can't think
Man, I been coastin' the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washin' my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can't choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sittin' in the VIP
Shovin' champagne through the next girl throat
[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the Moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the Moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the skies, and go dance on the Moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew?
Cop lights, no lights, 'cause the bills, they was overdue
Now a skinny-iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Takin' trips to the side of the Moon
Had to take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that, that a little thick
Better watch your toke, don't wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I'm on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just gon' cruise, hit the brews, lay back, don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy, 'cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man, it can't be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress, it can't fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it, and then she on the Moon, my nigga
[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the Moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the Moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the skies, and go dance on the Moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

[Bridge: Theophilus London &

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the Moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the Moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the skies, and go dance on the Moon
Where the weather is warm

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Hold up (Hold up)
I'm headed to the moon, 'cause the world screwed up
Like the city I grew up
So I'm pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you spill my cup, it'll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time, call that "triple OG"
In the triple D, I'm full when I'm on E, you don't know nothing 'bout me
Backwood feel with a Compton tree
Gettin' full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt, but I ain't no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco
, 
piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doin' that shit
Def' rockin' link, what you know about this?
Baby Bash came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a Soma Twist on the Moon
Gettin' higher than a bitch, and I'm doin' my dance

[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the Moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the Moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the skies, and go dance on the Moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long
