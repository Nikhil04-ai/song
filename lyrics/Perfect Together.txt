I know I'm not perfect sometimes

Perfect together (Perfect Together)
Perfect together
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
It's amazing, so amazing
That we are still here, yeah
Cause we're changing, re-arranging
But I still see you clear
[Pre-Chorus]
How can I love you more than this?
Tell me the way and I can fix it
[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect sometimes
You know you’re not perfect sometimes
But even when it’s wrong it feels right cause we’re perfect together
(Perfect Together)
Perfect together (Perfect Together)
Perfect together (Perfect Together)
Perfect together

[Verse 2]
No more lonely nights, no more city lights
And when I'm feeling in the worst way, you know how to bring me back baby
Light shines through the crowd now, darkest days in the past nights
You don’t know what you do to me, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
How can I love you more than this?
Tell me the way and I can fix it
[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect sometimes
You know you’re not perfect sometimes
But even when it’s wrong it feels right cause we’re perfect together
(Perfect Together)
Perfect together (Perfect Together)
Perfect together (Perfect Together)
Perfect together
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
