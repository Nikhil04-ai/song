Artist: Doja Cat
[Intro]
For them hatin' ass niggas, this payback
This payback
Nigga, 'dis payback (Ha-ha)
Uh, don't say that (Bitch)
But 'dis payback (Woo! Woo!)
Bitch
[Verse]
Hittin' that dough
Killin' that, feelin' that flow
Rippin' that, flippin' that dro (Woah)
Gettin' that gold
Hit to the shit that we know
24 karat and all
Tearin' it off
Starin' at y'all while I inherit the stars (Whoop! Whoop!)
Chillin' in no Sybaris with pirates and pilots
I'm that fly shit
We don't buy shit, we just claim that
Like lions in the club, can't tame that (Swag, swag, swag, swag)
Dropped outta school when I came back with that same swag and they changed rap (Yeah)
'Cause y'all so used to the same crap
Swear I'm on a plane to my game trap
For them hatin' ass niggas, 'dis payback, uh (Bitch)

[Chorus]
(Yah)
Hatin' ass niggas, 'dis payback (Hatin' ass nigga 'dis payback)
'Dis payback
Fuck lame rap and that wack shit (This payback)
Fuck yo' wack shit, fuck yo' wack, fuck that wack, fu-fuck yo wack (Fuck that wack shit, fuck that wack shit)
This that payback (That payback, hatin' ass niggas, 'dis payback, fuck that wack shit)
[Outro]
Doja (Fuck that, fuck that wack shit)
Rawr (Bitch)
Fuckin', yuh (How you know that? So shut the fuck up [?])
(You weak, so do not try to fuck with all my team)
Shout out to all my niggas in Jersey (Do not spend more [?])
(And do not try to act like you the shit, fuck you think?)
To Philly (We gettin' bank)
To all my niggas in LA (Come in [?] we be dank)
I fucks with you (Smokin' that)
(Rockin' chains, get the Benz and fuckin' limo to the bank)
(Swag)
(You fucked up, Doja, what's wrong wit'chu?)
Woo (Why you do that?)
Smoke that reefer (Why you do that? Why you-)
This that payback (Aw man)
(Err)
Bitch
