Title: Real Street Migo
Artist: Crush
[Intro: Boobie Lootaveli]
I'm a street migo (Ayy, ayy, you dig?), I'm a street migo
I'm a street migo (Willy Snow, crank that shit up), duh
I'm a street migo, duh, I'm a street migo (You dig?)
I'm a street migo (Ayy, ayy)
(
Willy did this mothafucker, bruh
)
[Chorus: Boobie Lootaveli]
I'm a street Migo, wrap them babies in the plastic
I be totin' 'round some tools bigger than Jurassic
Now my old homie hate me 'cause I made it happen
Thought that he would want me in a Wraith, not a casket
Man, this life will teach you things that you wouldn't imagine
How you say that he your dawg, but he went to rattin'?
We be movin' like a marching band when we clappin'
Got a .40 with the nuts, if you want your ass kissed
[Verse 1: Boobie Lootaveli]
Bitch, this trap shit is easy, why you doin' average?
My lil zoes up the road swipin', doin' damage
They gon' take a trip across the tracks for the package
Tryna sell out all these shows, bitch, I want that backend
What that thing goin' down your back, girl, is that your baggage?
I love when she get to clappin' it, I gets to rattlin'
Pull up on you like "What's happenin', bitch?" Ain't got no manners
Hit you with some numbers, it's not addin' up? Then I'm subtractin', bitch
A lot up on my plate today, I'm doin' numbers, huh
If you ain't make one play today, then what you doin', huh?
You know I be with the shits so what we moving, ho?
I'm a real street migo, I be glidin' through the room

[Chorus: Boobie Lootaveli]
I'm a street migo, wrap them babies in the plastic
I be totin' 'round some tools bigger than Jurassic
Now my old homie hate me 'cause I made it happen
Thought that he would want me in a Wraith, not a casket
Man, this life will teach you things that you wouldn't imagine
How you say that he your dawg, but he went to rattin'?
We be movin' like a marching band when we clappin'
Got a .40 with the nuts, if you want your ass kissed
[Verse 2: Pouya]
I want smoke, I want smoke, I want bullets in my head
Let me go, let me go, I guess I'm better off for dead
This life I'm livin' ain't right, I should've stayed in school instead of droppin' out
Sittin' on the couch with a cigarette in my mouth
But if I did that, I'd be broke, sittin' in the Honda Civic with that
Broken taillight and an ugly ho
But now they love me, now I'm knockin' them down like dominoes
Chopper to chop you up and put your finger in a envelope, lil' ho
Why you wanna play me like a bitch?
Runnin' 'round with my style, you know you not authentic with it
Admit it, get out of your feelings, I've been in the game for a minute
Show some respect to the legacy
Been waitin' for somebody to kill me, to show me you love me, yuh
[Chorus: Boobie Lootaveli]
I'm a street migo, wrap them babies in the plastic
I be totin' 'round some tools bigger than Jurassic
Now my old homie hate me 'cause I made it happen
Thought that he would want me in a Wraith, not a casket
Man, this life will teach you things that you wouldn't imagine
How you say that he your dawg, but he went to rattin'?
We be movin' like a marching band when we clappin'
Got a .40 with the nuts, if you want your ass kissed
