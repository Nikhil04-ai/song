Title: I Want Love
Artist: Elton John
[Verse 1]
I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
[Verse 2]
And I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart
[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love
[Verse 3]
I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man, I've seen so much traffic
[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

[Bridge]
So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love
[Chorus]
I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love
