Title: Saturn Returns Interlude
Artist: Ariana Grande
 
[Interlude: Diana Garland]
When we're all born, Saturn's somewhere
And the Saturn cycle takes around about twenty-nine years
That's when we gotta wake up and smell the coffee
Because if we've just been sort of relying on our cleverness
Or relying—, you know, just kind of floating along
Saturn comes along and hits you over the head
Hits you over the head, hits you over the head, and says, "Wake up"
Aha, it's time for you to get real about life and sort out who you really are
[Outro]
Wake up
Get real
