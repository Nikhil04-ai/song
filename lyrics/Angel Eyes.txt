Title: Angel Eyes
Artist: Frank Sinatra
Â 
[Intro]
Hey, drink up, all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun, you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me
[Verse 1]
Try to think that love's not around
Still, it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gainin' any ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here
[Verse 2]
Angel eyes, that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight?
[Bridge]
So, drink up, all of you people
Order anything you see
And have fun, you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me
[Verse 3]
Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now the number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here

[Outro]
'Scuse me, while I disappear
