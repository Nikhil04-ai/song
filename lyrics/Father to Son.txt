Title: Father to Son
Artist: Queen
 
[Intro]
[Verse 1]
A word in your ear, from father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
Long before you were born
[Chorus]
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
[Verse 2]
And the voice is so clear, time after time
It keeps calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see, your country to be
Just keep building on the ground that's been won
[Chorus]
Kings will be crowned, and the word goes around
From father to son, to son
[Bridge]
Won't you hear us sing our family song?
(Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba)
Ooh yeah, now we hand it on
But I've heard it all before
Take this letter that I give you
Take it, sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die, yeah, yeah

[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
A word in your ear from father to son
Funny, you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you will stay by your side
Through the years 'till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will
But the air you breathe, I live to give you
Father to son, father to son
[Chorus]
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around…
