Oh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off my mind
But I can't
Just the thought of you (

Turns my whole world Nipsey Blue

Oh, homie
Just the mention of your name (

Makes me wanna, paint my game
Listen to me, homie
When I think of the things we used to do, ooh, ooh
And my whole world turns Nipsey Blue
