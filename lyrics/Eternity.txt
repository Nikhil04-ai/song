Title: Eternity
Artist: Lionel Richce
[Chorus]
There is a place for us, for all the world to see
There is a place out there I know, somewhere, for all eternity
[Verse 1]
Here we stand, all God's children together
Tryna see where we belong
With hills and valleys to conquer
It's time we weathered the storm
Everybody's looking for something, mm
Something they can hold on to
We're lost in a sea of confusion
It's hard to know what to do, oh
[Chorus]
There is a place for us, for all the world to see
And there is a place, I'm there, I know, for all eternity
[Verse 2]
Where do we go? Tell me, sisters and brothers
How much wrong must we do to be right?
It's time that we look in the mirror, mm
It's time that we see the same light
I know, I know everybody's searching
Why can't we just all get along?
It's time that we all come together
It's time that we sing the same song, wow

[Chorus]
There is a place for us, for all the world to see
There is a place, I'm there, I know, for all, yeah, eternity
[Bridge]
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, the sun will shine
Oh, I know, I know for all mankind, oh, for all mankind
Where we can find love, oh love, oh love
[Chorus]
(Oh, there's a place) There is a place for us (I know), for all the world to see
There is a place out there, I know, for all eternity
There is a place for us, for all the world to see
(I know) There is a place, I know, for all eternity (Yeah, oh yeah)
Eternity, eternity (Yeah, yeah, oh)
Eternity
[Outro]
For all eternity
