Title: Just Look Up
Artist: Ariana Grande
 
[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Mm-mm, hmm
Ah, ah
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
We knew no bounds
Fell at the speed of sound
Ridin' against all odds, but soon against ourselves
You haunted every memory
With no goodbyes, all bad for me
Your pride put out the fire in our flames
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Then just one look is all it takes
I feel your eyes, they're locked on every part of me
And then my dumb heart says
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Just look up
There is no place to hide
True love doesn't die
It holds on tight and never lets you go
Just look up
You cannot deny the signs
What you'vе waited for
Don't wait no more
It's right up above you
Just look up

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi & 
Ariana Grande
]
(Baby)
Know I lеt you down, a nigga can't deny it (Uh-huh)
And there's so much I could lose and, yes, that matters (Yeah)
I've been dealin' with madness (Yo)
Wasn't the man you needed (Hmm)
You dealin' with sadness, truthfully, it's all on me (Hmm)
And I'm sorry, my love
I'ma heal your heart, I'll hold it in my hand (
Ooh, ah-ah
)
Time is oh so precious, we don't really have much left now (
Ooh
)
Take my hand, baby, never leave you, Riley
[Verse 3: Ariana Grande]
Look up, what he's really trying to say
Is get your head out of your ass
Listen to the goddamn qualified scientists
We really fucked it up, fucked it up this time
It's so close, I can feel the heat big time
And you can act like everything is alright
But this is probably happening in real time
Celebrate or cry or pray, whatever it takes
To get you through the mess that we made
'Cause tomorrow may never come
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Just look up
Turn off that shit Box News
'Cause you're about to die soon everybody
Ooh, I, I, oh, I
Look up
Here it comes
I'm so glad I'm here with you forever
In your arms
