Artist: Justin Bieber
Â 
[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Never say never
(
Pick it up, pick, pick it up
)
(
Pick it up, pick, pick it up
) Yeah, yeah
(
Pick it up, pick, pick it up
) never-ever, never-ever-ever-ever, eh, eh
(
Pick it up, pick, pick it up
) Ah
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See, I never thought that I could walk through fire (Eh)
I never thought that I could take the burn (Eh)
I never had the strength to take it higher (Eh)
Until I reached the point of no return (Eh)
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight 'till forever (Make it right)
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
And never say never

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
(
Pick it up, pick, pick it up
) Ne-Never say never
(
Pick it up, pick, pick it up
) Ne-Never say never
(
Pick it up, pick, pick it up
) Ne-Never say never
(
Pick it up, pick, pick it up
) Never say it, never-never say it
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I never thought that I could feel this power (Eh)
I never thought that I could feel this free (Eh)
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower (Yeah)
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause there's just no turning back (Oh, no)
When your heart's under attack (Oh, no)
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never (Never say never; I will fight)
I will fight 'till forever (Never fighting, but I'm still fighting; Make it right)
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up (Yeah)
And never say never (Never, never, never, never)
[Interlude: Justin Bieber & 
Jaden
]
Here we go (
Guess who?
)
J. Smith and JB (
Uh-huh
)
I gotcha, lil bro (Oh, no)
I can handle them, hold up, aight?
 (Never, never, never say it)
I can handle them

[Verse 3: Jaden & 
Justin Bieber
]
(
Pick it up, pick
) Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
(
Pick it up, pick
) And he's older than me and stronger than me
(
Pick it up, pick
) And his arms a little bit longer than me
(
Pick it up, pick
) But he ain't on a JB song with me (Oh)
(
Pick, pick it up
) I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
(
Pick it up, pick, pick it up
) No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
(
Pick, pick it up
) Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
(
Pick it up, pick, pick it up
) Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood (Let's go)
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest (Fly, fly)
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant (What? What?)
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
, so the moon's where I land (
Yeah, yeah
; I'm gone)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber & 
Jaden
]
I will never say never (
Never say it, never-never say it
; I will fight)
I will fight 'til forever (
Okay, okay
; To make it right)
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground (Oh, woah)
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up (Yeah)
And never say never (Never say never)
I will never say never (
Never say it, never-never say it
; Never say never)
I will fight 'till forever (
Okay
; To make it right)
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
And never say never

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber & 
Jaden
]
Ne-Never say never (
Never say it
)
Ne-Never say never (
Never say it
)
Ne-Never say never (
Never say it
)
And never say never (No, no, never say never)
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
Ne-Never say never (Ne-Ne-Never say it)
Ne-Never say never
And never say never
