[Intro]
M-M-Murda
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
He laid down his life, paid the price, yeah, get that
Comin' with the drama, lil' mama I ain't with that
Breakin' up the bread, pour the wine and I sip that
I ain't gotta flex, I already got a six pack
This that Hallelujah
I ain't tryna break it down but I'll break it to you
Fake friends come around but don't let 'em use you
I don't wanna lose you
Let the spirit move you
Ain't it funny how the money and the cars and the clothes
Weren't nun ‘til I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe Him
Ain't it funny how the money and the cars and the clothes
Weren't nun ‘til I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe Him
[Verse 1: Quavo]
How many crosses on my neck, let me check
I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
How many crosses on my neck, let me check
I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
Holy water on the neck
And that's what I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
Holy water on the neck
And that's what I need more (Ice), I need more (Go)
Holy cross, let me shake the demons off (Holy)
He lost that prize in the sauce (Holy)
Pay your ties, young man, pay the cost (Ties)
Pay your ties, young man, pay the cost (Yeah)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
He laid down his life, paid the price, yeah, get that
Comin' with the drama, lil' mama I ain't with that
Breakin' up the bread, pour the wine and I sip that
I ain't gotta flex, I already got a six pack
This that Hallelujah
I ain't tryna break it down but I'll break it to you
Fake friends come around but don't let 'em use you
I don't wanna lose you
Let the spirit move you
Ain't it funny how the money and the cars and the clothes
Weren't nun ‘til I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe Him
Ain't it funny how the money and the cars and the clothes
Weren't nun' ‘til I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe Him
