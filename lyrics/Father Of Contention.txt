Artist: Crush
[Verse 1]
[?] where you at? I need your help
I can't deal, with some of these suckers by myself
Let me know, is you with me or not?
"Pop pop" goes the Glock, come and get it while it's hot
She down for the cuff, she do what I say
Move when I say to, poppin' that pussy, doin' tricks
That really would amaze you (Yup)
'Cause I'da came up without a record here to claim to, you bitch
Pull up to the scene with my middle finger bashing
Yes, I know that that's your pumpkin, do you know that I been smashing
With a band of homies, did so much, digging the cuts to get the front
Or maybe buy my kidney, homie, miss me with that fuck shit
Pull up to the function, hit the stage and get it jumpin'
Run upon me, get to gushin', I ain't never been a hoe
Runnin' around with plus fours, so
Make a move, I'm the one you gotta cater to, bitch
[Chorus]
"Pop pop" goes the Glock, come and get it while it's hot
"Pop pop" goes the Glock, come and get it while it's hot
Pop pop (yup)
Pop pop (yup)
Pop pop (come and get it while it's hot)
Pop pop (come and get it while it's hot)
Pop pop (yup)
Pop pop (yup)
Pop pop (come and get it while it's hot)
Pop pop (come and get it while it's hot)

[Verse 2]
In front of my face, you a friend to me
Behind my back, you really envy me
So to me you just an enemy
Pop that clip, but you [?]
So many places that I'd rather be
But I'm in the studio, just tryna make my paper stack
B.E.T. that your bitch, gon' thow it back
If I ask her to, I don't got a answer to
Why she feel in love with me, guess she love my attitude
I just do what I do 'cause I love it, I can't fuck with none of you rappers
I'm 'bout to fire off on 'em like I'm NASA
Trust me, lil' homie, I will turn into a bastard
Lay your old, dirty ass on the floor like a mattress
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with?
Still sleepin' on me, I'm so sick and tired of it
I'm feelin like the underground underdog
I been on the runway for a minute, now I'm taking off
Nut sack for the bitches who been [?]
And the haters that don't wanna see my money talk
You ain't talkin' about no check, then I won't answer your call
Unless you callin' with a bitch that wanna pop that pussy slow
Just for me, and the homies
Or maybe everyone who know me
Bitch, show me what you workin' with
All them tricks that you been learning, bitch
