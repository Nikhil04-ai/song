Title: She Donâ€™t Have to Know
Artist: John Legend
[Produced by Will.I.Am]
[Intro]
Oh, stealing moments just to be with you
Though it's wrong, it's hard to tell the truth
Oh, no, she don't have to know (She don't have to know)
She don't have to know
[Verse 1]
When I meet 'cha
I got my shades on to cover up my eyes
(Just to cover up my eyes)
I'm hoping that nobody sees me passing by
Through my disguise
I still know (I still know) you recognize
But you
I know you got a little secret of your own
(You know you're wrong)
Sneaking out with me while your man's at home
You know you're wrong
But it's so strong (So strong) still carrying on
[Chorus]
I go
To the other side of town, so I
Never risk the chance will catch her eye, oh no
She don't have to know (She don't have to know)
She don't have to know
Oh
Girl, I know you're doing the same thing too
But I won't tell your man the things we do, oh no
He don't have to know (He don't have to know)
He don't have to know

[Verse 2]
Someone's watching
We got to be careful next time or we're through
But damn it's so stressful doing the dirt we do
So sad, but true
And I know one day (One day) I'm gonna pay
Baby, you ask me
To sneak out of town for just a day or three
(One, two, three)
Go to D.C. and hold hands publicly
All through the streets
Cause they don't know you (They don't know you)
They don't know me
[Chorus]
And oh
I'll feel sorry for mistakes we've made
There's no reason that we should tell her today
She don't have to know (She don't have to know)
She don't have to know (She don't have to know)
Girl, oh
Though you give a lot of love to me
Girl, I know I'm not the only one you see, but
He don't have to know (He don't have to know)
He don't have to know (He don't have to know)

[Bridge]
Oh, it's getting crazy
I don't want to hurt my baby
And I know it's supposed to be the last time for you and I
But let's not end this way, just wait another day
[Outro]
Oh
I don't want to let you go and I
So I just can't let her go
She don't have to know, yeah
Oh
I know you're doin' the same thing to her
Oh, he don't
They don't have to know, yeah
Oh
