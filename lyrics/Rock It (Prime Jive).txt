[Intro: Freddie Mercury, 
Roger Taylor

When I hear
That rock and roll
It gets down to my soul
When it is real rock and roll
Oh, rock and roll
When I hear
That rock and roll
It gets down to my soul
When it is real rock and roll
Oh, rock and roll
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1: Roger Taylor]
You really think they like
To rock in space?
Well, I don't know, what do you know?
What do you hear
On the radio?
Coming through the air
[Pre-Chorus: Roger Taylor]
I said Mama
I ain't crazy
I am alright, alright

[Chorus: Roger Taylor]
Hey, c'mon baby, said it's alright
To rock and roll on a Saturday night
I said shoot and get your suit
And come along with me
I said c'mon baby down
Come and rock with me
I said yeah
[Verse 2: Roger Taylor]
What do you do
To get to feel alive?
You go downtown
And get some of that prime jive
[Pre-Chorus: Roger Taylor]
I said Mama
I ain't crazy
I am alright, alright
[Chorus: Roger Taylor]
Hey, c'mon baby said it's alright
To rock and roll on a Saturday night
I said shoot and get your suit
And come along with me
I said c'mon baby down
Come and rock with me
I said yeah
We're gonna rock it

[Guitar Solo: Brian May]
[Chorus: Roger Taylor]
Hey, c'mon baby said it's alright
To rock and roll on a Saturday night
I said shoot and get your suit
And come along with me
I said c'mon baby down
Come and rock with me
I said yeah
