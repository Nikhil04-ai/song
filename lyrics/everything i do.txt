Title: everything i do
Artist: Ariana Grande
 
[Chorus]
The things I'd never do, it's like, I do for you
And words I'd never say, but now, I say them too
And boy I'll never know, the things you get me through
'Cause everything I do, it's like, I do for you
[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd wake up
, my mind was super fucked up
But nothing ever happened, and everything I made up
They knew our love was fiction, 
your love was just a vision
But I'm still tryna see it boy
[Pre-Chorus]
I swear you were just right next to me
I swear you were just right next to me
You tell me it was just a dream
There must be something wrong with me
[Chorus]
The things I'd never do, it's like, I do for you (Oh, baby)
And words I'd never say, but now, I say them too (Oh, yeah)
And boy I'll never know, the things you get me through
'Cause everything I do, it's like, I do for you
[Verse 2]
So now I guess I'll have to, 
love a little harder
 (Yeah)
Write a lot more often (Yuh)
Make a fuckin' billion
'Cause if perhaps I’m living for two of us (Two of us)
I'll have to lift twice as much

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear you were just right next to me
I swear you were just right next to me
You tell me it was just a dream
There must be something wrong with me
[Chorus]
Said, the things I'd never do, it's like I do for you
And words I'd never say, but now, I say them too (Yuh)
And boy you'll never know, the things you get me through
'Cause everything I do, it's like, I do for you (Oh, ah)
[Outro]
I, say them too
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah, ay)
