Title: So Young, So Bad, So What
Artist: Etta James
[Verse 1]
Well, they call her a troublemaker
She gets all the blame
You know they love to hold her
But they can't control her
'Cause she's too hot to tame
[Chorus]
So young, so bad, so what?
So young, so bad, so what?
[Verse 2]
She's a rebel, she can't help it
When they get down on her case
If you don't understand her
Don't try to apprehend her
'Cause she'll laugh right in your face
[Chorus]
So young, so bad, so what?
So young, so bad, so what?
[Verse 3]
She got a back street education
Living by her own rules
You can say that she's a loner
But that's no cause to stone her
'Cause the girl's just way too cool

[Chorus]
So young, so bad, so what?
She's so young, she's so bad, so what?
She's so young and so bad, so what?
So young, so bad, so what?
