Title: Owe
Artist: Dua Lipa
[Verse 1]
It never rains in California
The grass is greener on my side
Walkin' away from the wreckage
The hottest car upon my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
I was sunk in a whirlwind without you
I was down in the dirt, it was nothing new
Like an ocean of glass, I was swimming through, oh
[Chorus]
I owe it all to you, you, you
I owe it all to you, you, you
Sometimes you're only by yourself
When you're losing someone else
So I owe it all to you, you, you
I owe it all to you, you, you
I forgot I was alive
'Til I heard the words "Goodbye"
So I owe it all to you, you
[Verse 2]
Won't raise my hands to the heavens
Like the Joshua tree
Sometimes it's only in the darknеss
I can see the light in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Freedom ringin' in my heart likе a wedding bell
Not afraid to see you leave, boy, I wish you well
So I'm sittin' here in silence, alone in the town
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
I owe it all to you, you, you
I owe it all to you, you, you
Sometimes you only find yourself
When you're losing someone else
So I owe it all to you, you, you
I owe it all to you, you, you
I forgot I was alive
'Til I heard the words "Goodbye"
So I owe it all to you, you, oh
[Bridge]
I was sunk in a whirlwind without you
I was down in the dirt, it was nothing new
Like an ocean of glass, I was swimming through
[Chorus]
So I owe it all to you, you, you
I owe it all to you, you, you
Sometimes you only find yourself
When you're losing someone else
So I owe it all to you, you, you
I owe it all to you, you, you
I forgot I was alive
'Til I heard the words "Goodbye"
So I owe it all to you
