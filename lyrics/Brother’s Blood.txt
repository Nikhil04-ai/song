Title: Brotherâ€™s Blood
Artist: Ed Sheeran
Lyrics From Snippet
Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heart
Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heart
