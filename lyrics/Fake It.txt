Title: Fake It*
Artist: Lauv
Snippet
Long days, long nights, some place that I've never been
Good morning, good night
Woke up dreaming in someone else's color
I feel black and white
Yeah, I could waste my life
Trying to be something I know I'll never be
I don't know if I'm gon' make it
But I'm sure as hell gon' fake it
Yeah, I'm sure as hell gon' fake it 'til I die
And I don't know if I still want it
But if I'm being honest
I'm sure as hell gon' fake it 'til I die
