Title: Close to Me
Artist: Doja Cat
[Chorus]
My eyes are open wide awake but I'm running on no sleep
Finally free, yeah
I won't stray if you get close to me (Yeah)
When you get closer, we get closer
You get close to me
[Verse]
You better hunt me down 'cause I don’t wanna have it, boy
It must be you and me
I just don’t need nobody but all your body
Fuck what anybody say
Call me, "Desperate, high, horny," call me, "Lonely"
But I can’t tell no lie, not no phony
This inside of me got control of me (Yah)
I know it’s not a phase
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Somethin' different about you (Yuh), lips and a tattoo
Got 'еm stick like a bamboo
Ain't shit that you can't do (Ain't shit that you can't do)
Get your hit when you want to
But don't gеt it twist like a bantu
Bitches is bad news (Yah)
Them chicks that you talk to (Yah), risk for your pocket (Woo)
This outta pocket
I'm rich and she not shit, lit and she not wit
Changin' my mind
Come lay wit' a dime, get it? Get it?
Come lay wit' a dime
You fillet with her mind
Till her mind dead, play with her mind
I'on play with his time
Kill brain, that’s a crime (Yah)
Claim what we like till the day that we die (Feel it)
Till the d-day, till the day that we die (That we die)
Swear that you’re savin' my life (Yah)

[Chorus]
My eyes are open wide awake, but I'm running on no sleep
Finally free, yeah
I won't stray if you get close to me (Yeah)
When you get closer, we get closer
You get close to me (Closer, baby)
And we- 
*scatting*
(Yeah baby)
[Outro]
Dance at mine
'Cause your love
Come back to mine, to mine
No love
Come dance at mine all night
Oh, why
No love
No, come dance at mine
Oh, why?
No love
Your love
With, no love
Baby, no love
