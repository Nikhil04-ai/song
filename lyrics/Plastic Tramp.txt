Title: Plastic Tramp
Artist: Arctic Monkeys
A B-Side to the hit Fluorescent Adolescent, Alex laments about encounters with Plastic Tramps, aka, fake beggars.
[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
He looks as if he hasn't slept
His hair is purposely unkept
In many doorways, people wept
When you crafted your plan
[Refrain: Alex Turner]
Shadows underneath the eyes
And everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me
[Pre-Chorus: Alex Turner]
There's nothing really I can say
But "Sorry, mate" and walk away
I could be wrong on this, you play your game
This world is cruel and most unkind
And horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all
[Chorus: Alex Turner]
You're lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
Lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination

[Verse 2: Alex Turner]
Is he really on the street?
Desperation or deceit?
And what he's wearing on his feet
Won't solve our mystery
And I am baffled by how you stand there soaking it in
And do you hide your identity
Where you hide your grin?
You'd better hide your grin
[Refrain: Alex Turner, Matt Helders, Jamie Cook & Andy Nicholson]
Shadows underneath the eyes
And everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me
[Pre-Chorus: Alex Turner]
There's nothing really I can say
But "sorry, mate" and walk away
I could be wrong on this, you play your game
This world is cruel and most unkind
And horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all
[Chorus: Alex Turner]
You're lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
Lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
And the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
