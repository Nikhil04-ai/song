Artist: Ed Sheeran
Â 
[Verse 1]
I heard you callin', now my eyes are open
The day is breakin' into powder blue
Sunlight is framin' our every moment
What a way to start off the day with you
[Pre-Chorus]
Flick a finger
Start a discussion to pick a singer
This one, you'll love it, I had to bring her
Just let the speakers take you away
[Chorus]
And drop the needle on Dusty
Frost on the leaves like a lake
The moment came out of nothin'
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night
But I got a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in the low tide
But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty
[Verse 2]
We were lost within a stormy ocean
Nobody knew what we were going through
We talk about it as we dip our toes in
Take a breath and brace for the waves with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Flick a finger
Wait for the magic to do its thing, yeah
There's more than sadness we got within us
Let's put some colour into the grey
[Chorus]
And drop the needle on Dusty
Frost on the leaves like a lake
The moment came out of nothin'
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night
But I got a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in the low tide
But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty
[Bridge]
Nothing static on the stereo before today (Before today)
Both on the edge to throw it all away (Throw it all away)
I used to think that every situation stayed the same (The same)
But I can see it start to change (Start to change), okay
[Chorus]
Drop the needle on Dusty
Frost on the leaves like a lake
The moment came out of nothin'
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night
But I got a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in the low tide
But we gotta wait till our clothes are bone dry
So I'll drop the needle on Dusty

[Outro]
Drop the needle on Dusty
Drop the needle on Dusty
