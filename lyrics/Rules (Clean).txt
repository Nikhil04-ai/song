Title: Rules (Clean)
Artist: Doja Cat
[Chorus]
Said play with my *****
But don't play with my emotions (Emotions)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might **** ya
When I shake (Shake) in slow motion (Motion)
You got a whole lotta cash and you know I want it (Want it)
Play with my *****
Don't play with my emotions (Emotions, yeah)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might **** ya
When I shake (Shake) in slow motion (Motion, slow motion, yeah)
You got a whole lotta cash and you know I want it (You know I want it)
[Verse 1]
Break some bread up, that butter my biscuit (Hah)
Ye'ain't talk money, then really, that's none of my business (That's none of my biz)
I don't even need these lenses (Yeah)
20 on 20 my vision (Woo)
Bad yellow ***** with her eye on the prize
But I ain't no minion (Yeah, yeah)
Millions, thousands, billions (Trillions)
Bobs on me like Dylan, blondes on me like Hilton
Wendys on me like Williams, shouting, digging
Look at me like I'm alien, ******* reptilian
(Yeah, yeah) Aww
All y'all ******* was wrong
Talkin' 'bout I fell off
You ain't even get on
Yaw
All y'all ******* is precious
Wait, I meant to say jealous
All y'all ******* is jealous

[Chorus]
Said play with my *****
But don't play with my emotions (Emotions)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might **** ya
When I shake (Shake) in slow motion (Motion)
You got a whole lotta cash and you know I want it (Want it)
Play with my *****
Don't play with my emotions (Emotions, yeah)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might **** ya
When I shake (Shake) in slow motion (Motion, slow motion, yeah)
You got a whole lotta cash and you know I want it (You know I want it)
[Verse 2]
(And now you playin' with my emotions)
Don't do it, you blew it
You tryna cast spells on a ***** with potions
I need devotion
(Leaving you with that lotion)
Telling me this and that, the third
That **** for the birds, I'm ghostin'
If you don't dive in that ***** like dolphins
If he don't dive in that ***** like oceans
Twins look identically like Olsens
Don't hide from the *****, be open
Wan' spy on the ***** like Austin
(Do I make you horny, baby?)
That's my ego that you stroking
*****, don't laugh 'cause the ***** ain't joking
*****, go splash when the ***** be soakin'
Yeah, where that ***** who don't play mind games at?
You got a fake gold chain on, change that
Tryna spit game while I'm on my way out, late ***
Where that *****, man? Where he at? Where he at?

[Chorus]
Said play with my *****
But don't play with my emotions (Emotions)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might **** ya
When I shake (Shake) in slow motion (Motion)
You got a whole lotta cash and you know I want it (Want it)
Play with my *****
Don't play with my emotions (Emotions, yeah)
If you spend some money, then maybe I just might **** ya
When I shake (Shake) in slow motion (Motion, slow motion, yeah)
You got a whole lotta cash and you know I want it (You know I want it)
