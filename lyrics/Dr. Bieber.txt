[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, I got a PHD, I don't need a fake ID
Yeah you females know of me, I'm so sick with no IV
J to the U to the S to the T, Bieber fever's in the street
It's time to realise I'mma beast, I'mma beast, I'mma beast
Say it 3 times cause they know it's right, catch this virus in the night
I know it's incurable, it's durable but it's alright
It just spread across the globe into every single home
Every city, every country, every girl is on the phone
Oh my gosh I love him, isn't he perfect?
You can be my queen, yeah I'll show you how I work it
How I work it, how I how I work it
How I work it, how I how I work it
This is not a cold, not a flu, not a sickness
Baby this is good and it doesn't hurt to get this
You were never cured, and you'll never regret this
Yeah, my swag's up riding with Kenny in the Lexis

[Bridge: Kenny Hamilton]
Oh my God, it's 
Bieber fever
, it's everywhere
It's taking over the water, it's taking over the air streams
You can not run from it, you can not hide from it
That's why we call it Bieber fever
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Dr. Bieber, Dr. Bieber
Dr. Bieber, Dr. Bieber
Cure the fever, cure the fever
Cure the fever, cure the Bieber fever
Dr. Bieber, Dr. Bieber

Cure the fever, cure the fever
Cure the fever, cure the Bieber fever
