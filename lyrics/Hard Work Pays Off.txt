Title: Hard Work Pays Off
Artist: Future
Â 
[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid, oh
Tryna take it, then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper to your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off, dunk on a bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never played fair, throwin' elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blood all on my Rick Owens, yeah
[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Blood all on the Ricks, Ricks, Ricks, Ricks, Ricks
I'm richer than a bitch, bitch, bitch, white bitch
Blue face everywhere
Pull up, they stare
Fendi my underwear
She suck my dick, she like, "Damn," oh
I didn't need a money counter, counter
Money all over the kitchen counter, counter
I think I need me a money counter, counter
Money all over the kitchen counter, counter
Call my doctor to handle my pain
Perkies taking my life away
I'ma bag your bitch because I can
I'ma go take your wife away
Chopper on me, Afghanistan
That bitch kill many men
Over the bag, over the cash, yeah, I'm a money fan
Over the bag, on your ass, yeah, hoppin' out the van
Switched up to the Lam', how you niggas like me now? Yeah
No limit the gang, try it, they gon' shoot you down, yeah
Loaded up, they gon' gun you down

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid, oh
Tryna take it, then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper to your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off, dunk on a bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never played fair, throwin' elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blood all on my Rick Owens, yeah
[Verse 2: Future]
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Drippin' on 'em every day, steak sauce
Put the chopper to your head, take it off
Fast lane, taking it all
Breaking your ankle, Chris Paul
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so one of none, my legacy will never fade
I've been traumatized before, but still, I'm not afraid
I done seen friends turn foe, it don't amaze me
Came from the bottom of the creek, the shit was ugly
Made it to the top of the mountain, drinkin' muddy
Everyone around me changed and I feel so neglected
I been on the bird with some birds, they respect it, yeah, yeah
Twenty-four seven, every day, we get it in, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Started living out my dream, feel like I was born again

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid, oh
Tryna take it then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper to your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off, dunk on a bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never played fair, throwin' elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blood all on my Rick Owens, yeah
