Title: Tears
Artist: Bee Gees
[Verse 1]
I started out to be
The man behind the scenes
Knowing I was in above my head
For all that I could see
I never saw the truth
Now I'm alone
[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven only knows how much I'm missing you
Knowing I had heaven in my hands
And there will be tears, tears are mixed with rain
Keeper of my flame
[Chorus]
Time and tide is on my side
It stands forever
There will be nights of love
And yes there will be tears
I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears tonight
I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears
[Verse 2]
The silent telephone
The turning of the key
You're still inside of me
I'm not ashamed
For all that I can do
I can't forget your face
I call your name

[Pre-Chorus -Variation]
Heaven only knows what I've been crying for
And all I've done to keep this love alive
Even through my tears, tears are mixed with rain
Keeper of my flame
[Chorus]
[Chorus - Variation]
Soon there will be tears
Rolling down my world
Keeper of my flame
Time and tide is on my side
It stands forever
There will be nights of love
And yes there will be tears
[Coda]x3
I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears tonight
I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears
