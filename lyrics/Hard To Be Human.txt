Title: Hard To Be Human*
Artist: Lauv
[Lyrics from

[Verse 1]
Crashing tides , lonely highs
Hard to motivate
Oh my god, here it comes
Time to masturbate
And I can't believe that I just said that
In a song, in a song
Oh my god, I must be going wrong
[Chorus]
Why do I care 'bout what everyone thinks
It's so hard to be human, let alone think
About what I want, yeah I've been trying not to drink
But it's so hard to be human, so hard to be human
Ohhhhhhhhh
