Title: Gimme Stitches
Artist: Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
I can be your right of way
So we can get out of here
I've always been the one who runs from everyone
'Cause everyone's just too weird
Sink with someone tied to me
I'm makin' you volunteer
Another one has come and gone, they crawl along
Make them disappear
[Chorus]
Dress me up in stitches, it's now or never
Tired of wearin' black and blue
Dress me up in stitches, it's now or never
Dyin' to get my blood on you, blood on you
[Verse 2]
Take another stab at me
I promise in time I'll heal
But yesterday went on and on a bit too long
I waited out on high street
There's nothing to find out here
Another day has come and gone, they crawl along
Wastin' all these years
[Chorus]
Dress me up in stitches, it's now or never
Tired of wearin' black and blue
Dress me up in stitches,
 
it's now or never
Dyin' to get my blood on you

[Post-Chorus]
How can you go on when you're murderin' someone
Killin' me like you do?
Gimme stitches, now or never
Gimme stitches, now or never
Gimme stitches, now or never
Blood on you, blood on you
Blood on you, blood on you
Blood on you
[Chorus]
Dress me up in stitches, it's now or never
Tired of wearin' black and blue
Dress me up in stitches, it's now or never
Dyin' to get my blood on you
[Post-Chorus]
How can you go on when you're murderin' someone
Killin' me like you do?
Gimme stitches, now or never
Gimme stitches, now or never
Gimme stitches, now or never
Gimme stitches, now or never
Blood on you, blood on you
