[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q & 
Travis Scott

Bottom bitch say, "Ho," know you on top when the top get floored
Crib where the cop won't go, Rollie on bling-bling, neck-neck on ice
Tell a bitch, "Get right," make a nigga miss that flight, can a nigga hit that twice?
Should've never let us niggas in
Got my first M 2012, 'nother 100K in the mail
Free another homie on bail, money low, her pussy gon' sell
Tryna tell you money ain't sh—, when you tried to tell me water won't whip
When you tried to say this quarter won't flip, since Snoop, who the other rich Crip?
How Groovy get the Pringle man chip? Walkin' with a twenty-yard clip
Walkin' while a real nigga limp, black nigga, green grass, no golf
So on turn the satellite off from the set, feel like I died on that cross, hang on (Okay, okay, 
ooh-ooh
—Okay—
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
)

Should've never let us niggas in,
 
should've-should've-should've never let us niggas in (
Okay, okay, okay

Jacques was born April 30, ayy
Doctor said he won't be home in thirty days, he gon' be
Alright, alright, alright, alright

Mama said her son gon' be the shit
He gon' be alright, alright, alright, alright

Alright, alright, alright, alright
Feel like I'ma need me a sip
Feel like I'ma need me a bitch
Make me feel alright, alright, alright, alright
