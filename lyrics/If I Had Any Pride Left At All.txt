Title: If I Had Any Pride Left At All
Artist: Etta James
I wouldn't count the times we talked about tomorrow
And I wouldn't sing the lines if some one played our song
On lonely nights like this when I need a friend
You'd be the last one I'd call, oh, if I had any pride left at all
I would keep a place just to set your picture
Reach out to touch your face and feel you in my arms
And I wouldn't be here now, parked outside your house
Not ashamed to crawl, oh, if I had any pride left at all
And only a fool would still be wearing this ring
Ringing your front doorbell
And I wouldn't let my heart stay wrapped around your finger
And I wouldn't fall apart when you open the door
Like all the other times when your eyes met mine
These teardrops wouldn't fall, oh, if I had any pride left at all
Oh, if I had any pride left at all
