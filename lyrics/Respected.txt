Title: Respected
Artist: Travis Scott 
[Intro]
Yeah
[Chorus]
Respected chain popper (Chain), chain collector (Chain)
Stripper checker (Checker), 
ice weather (Brick)
Violator, soul taker (Woo), rump shaker
Trunk breaker (Break), noddin' off
In the backseat (Back, seat), ridin' off
At the top he glidin' off
Front to backseat ridin' soft (Back, seat)
[Bridge]
I want respect, respect it, yeah
I expect her right left at
Right where I left her
[Verse 1]
Can assume where shе from, bruh (Dang)
Fuck a come up (Ooh)
On the Rolls wherе I brung her
Got it from us (Got it)
Syrup sipper, perc' taker (Ah)
Narco shaker, IV flavors, hydrate us (Yeah)
On the hiatus, wine taster why I'm late up (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Then hours later, we make moves, dodge invaders (Ooh)
The cops hate us, hate me, five-star rate me (12)
Cousin spare me, tote that, that shit family

[Chorus]
Respected chain popper (Chain), chain collector (Chain)
Stripper checker (Checker), 
ice weather (Brick)
Violator, soul taker (Woo), rump shaker
Trunk breaker (Break), noddin' off
In the backseat (Back, seat), ridin' off
At the top he glidin' off
Front to backseat ridin' soft (Back, seat)
[Bridge]
I want respect, respect it
I expect her right left at
Back where I left from
[Verse 2]
Take her tools and then stretch 'em (Stretch)
Up in my section (Section)
Love they give, I can't measure (Love)
Body pressure (Body)
In the field, it's a desert (Desert)
Body texture, cop the feel it's like leather (Leather)
Right through my vessels, I can feel it in my levels (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I brought the angels (Ooh), take no chances with the devil (Ooh)
Shit, I'm a demon (Ooh)
Maybach got mirrors, shit, I seen it (12)
About this grind, Aretha Franklin, shit, I need it

[Bridge]
I want respect (Mm-mm)
[Chorus]
Respected chain popper (Chain), chain collector (Chain)
Stripper checker (Checker), 
ice weather (Brick)
Violator, soul taker (Woo), rump shaker
Trunk breaker (Break), noddin' off
In the backseat (Back, seat), ridin' off
At the top he glidin' off
Front to backseat ridin' soft (Back, seat)
