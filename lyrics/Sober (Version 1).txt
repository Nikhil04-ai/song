Title: Sober (Version 1)
Artist: Ariana Grande
 
[Intro]
Ah, hey
[Verse]
You can light me up, anytime you want
If I let you touch, you gon' be
Addicted to my love, I'm your only drug
Can never have too much, so baby you can
[Pre-Chorus]
Puff it, sip it, mhm yeah
Blow it, hold it, kiss me now
Baby when I'm with you I'm wasted
[Chorus]
It's like we're not sober, when you come closer
Boy I know, you know, that I'm tryna quit
But it's way too lit
I’m not sober, when you come closer
Boy, I know, I know you've been tryna quit
But you love this shit, oh yeah
