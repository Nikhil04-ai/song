[Intro]
I wanna ride your Harley
I wanna ride your Harley
I wanna ride your Harley
I wanna ride your Harley
I wanna ride your Harley
I wanna ride your Harley
I wanna ride your Harley

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get liquor in me (When I get liquor in me)
I go to X from PG (I go to X from PG)
I wanna fuck somebody, wanna crash the party, wanna touch my body
I wanna sip Bacardi (I wanna sip Bacardi)
Jump on it like a Harley (I'ma jump on it)
That’s how I like babe, I ain't a biker, but
I wanna ride your Harley (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
[Chorus]
I wanna ride your Harley (Ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)

[Verse 1]
I done forgot to mention, bring out the engines
We got the fuel go, in like syringes
We brought a Bentley, you brought a Benzes
You walk in the club, I kick the door off the hinges
Look
Hit the stage, your bitch know the words
Doj wrote the verse, I been overworked
Gotta pop the bottle, gonna hit the throttle
One sip Moscato, make the motor purr (Like)
I'ma get rough on that nigga
I’ma go back on that nigga
I'm 'bout to take him out
I wanna shake and put the titties and butt on that nigga
[Pre-Chorus]
When I get liquor in me (When I get liquor in me)
I go to X from PG (I go to X from PG)
I wanna fuck somebody, wanna crash the party, wanna touch my body
I wanna sip Bacardi (I wanna sip Bacardi)
Jump on it like a Harley (I'ma jump on it)
That's how I like it babe, I ain't a biker, but
I wanna ride your Harley (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
[Chorus]
I wanna ride your Harley (Ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Check up on the body with a dipstick
Big dick energy is how I live bitch
Pucker up, kiss your face, give a kiss bitch
You don't wanna get it twisted like a lipstick
Two bad bitches and they mad pretty
Call 'em bad kitties
We a tad litty
Got a jacket and the jeans with it
Lil’ somethin’ on my wrist make her freeze with it
Need a long dick nigga with the beads in it
Need a thick lil' daddy with the jeans whippin’
Need a tough boy with a lil' mean in him
Rub it in, make noise, let him sneak diss you
(Vroom, vroom) On that ass with the gang, gang
Can't switch up on 'em
I ain’t finna change lanes
While they got their handlebars and the bang, bang
Keep your bitch up on a leash let the chain swing
[Bridge]
I'ma get rough on that nigga
I'ma go back on that nigga
I'm 'bout to take him out
I wanna shake and put the titties and butt on that nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get liquor in me (When I get liquor in me)
I go to X from PG (I go to X from PG)
I wanna fuck somebody, wanna crash the party, wanna touch my body
I wanna sip Bacardi (I wanna sip Bacardi)
Jump on it like a Harley (I'ma jump on it)
That's how I like it babe, I ain't a biker, but
I wanna ride your Harley (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
[Chorus]
I wanna ride your Harley (Ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
I wanna ride your Harley (Wanna ride on it, wanna ride on it, wanna ride)
