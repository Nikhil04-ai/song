Title: Kids Again
Artist: Sam Smith
 
[Verse 1]
Can't believe I still avoid the East Side
Even though I know that you don't live there now
Lately you're the only thing on my mind
And I can't stop myself from drivin' by your house
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, every time I hear our song it kind of hurts me still
And, ooh, even after all this time, I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering
[Chorus]
Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somеbody change your world
And now you don't look back?
'Cause we'll nеver be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever
[Verse 2]
Livin' out of suitcases in hotels
Drinking way too much and talking through the night
Really wish I didn't know you so well
Wouldn't be so hard to leave the past behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, every time I hear our song it kind of hurts me still
And, ooh, even after all this time, I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering
[Chorus]
Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back?
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever
[Bridge]
Mmm, mmm
No, I, I, I, I
I'm, I'm
Mmm, mmm
[Chorus]
Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever
