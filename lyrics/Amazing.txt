Title: Amazing
Artist: Ed Sheeran
[Verse 1]
I caught a sickness and they don't know the name of it
I flew to Paris tryin' to get away, mm
I drown my sadness, embarrassed by the shame of it
But all it seems to do is magnify the pain
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I was a strong boy, head in the sand
If I were them, I would be the man
And my lips are searchin' for what happiness is
I'm draggin' my feet, tryin' to breathe again
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm tryna feel amazin'
Yeah, but I can't get out of my way and
Yeah, wish I could feel amazin'
But this is all that I can feel today
[Verse 2]
I tore the page and I put all of my weight on it
So I could stop it, tryin' to blow away, mm
The darkest days, well, I got all I could take from them
Startin' to think it'll never change
[Pre-Chorus]
I see my life is planned in front of me
And I don't need to do a thing just because I can
And my friends are talkin' like, "What's happened to him?"
I'm draggin' my feet, tryin' to breathe again, ayy

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm tryna feel amazin'
Yeah, but I can't get out of my way and
Yeah, wish I could feel amazin'
But this is all that I can feel today and
Yeah, I'm tryna feel amazin'
Yeah, but I can't get out of my way and
Yeah, wish I could feel amazin'
But this is all that I can feel today
[Verse 3]
I'm tryin' to think, at the same time, tryin' to say somethin'
Can't switch off my brain, so don't meditate
Every time I crack a smile, I can sense another tear comin'
That's kind of weird, but what can I say?
[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm on the edge and one push of the wind
Will send me flyin' deep into the unknown
I guess this is the time to let 'em all in
'Cause nothin' is worse than when you hit the low, and
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm tryna feel amazin'
Yeah, but I can't get out of my way and
Yeah, wish I could feel amazin'
But this is all that I can feel today and
Yeah, I'm tryna feel amazin'
Yeah, but I can't get out of my way and
Yeah, wish I could feel amazin'
But this is all that I can feel today, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, this is all that I can feel today
Yeah, this is all that I can feel today
