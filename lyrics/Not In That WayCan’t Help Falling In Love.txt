Title: Not In That Way/Canâ€™t Help Falling In Love
Artist: Sam Smith
PART 1: NOT IN THAT WAY
[Verse 1]
And I hate to say I love you
When it's so hard for me
And I hate to say I want you
When you make it so clear
You don't want me
[Chorus]
I'd never ask you cause deep down
I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say I'm sorry, believe me, I love you
But not in that way
[Verse 2]
And I hate to say I need you
I'm so reliant, I'm so dependent, I'm such a fool
When you're not there, I find myself singing the blues
Can't bear, can't face the truth
[Link]
You will never know that feeling
You will never see through these eyes
PART 2: CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE

[Outro]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
