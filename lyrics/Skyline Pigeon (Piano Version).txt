Title: Skyline Pigeon (Piano Version)
Artist: Elton John
[Verse 1]
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway
[Verse 2]
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinkin' of the ways that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey
[Refrain]
For just a skyline pigeon dreamin' of the open
Waitin' for the day
That he can spread his wings and fly away again
[Chorus]
Fly away
Skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind
Fly away
Skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind

[Verse 3]
Let me wake up in the mornin'
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun
[Refrain]
For just a skyline pigeon dreamin' of the open
Waitin' for the day
That he can spread his wings and fly away again
[Chorus]
Fly away
Skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind
Fly away
Skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very, so very far behind
