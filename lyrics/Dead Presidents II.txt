Artist: J.Cole
Â 
[Intro]
Yeah
Fayettenam
Uh
[Verse 1]
These niggas is playin' Russian roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is fool-less, no, we don't dance, all we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted
Heavy traffic in this rap shit, look how my lane shifted
Elevated my game, lifted my name, now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted, but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high, if I dropped, I would fall for eleven minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
If dope, then you should know the supplier's name
Is J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Cansecos wanna text us like Waco
Hard to remain faithful, niggas be throwin' hate
Yo, I'm in a league of my own, so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in, but didn't fit in
Naw, I ain't Maury Povich, but who the fuck is you kiddin'?
These big-wig niggas throwin' they bid in
Try not to show stress, I guess the flow is protested like a sit-in
I told my niggas we would get in, but that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow or you catapult
Now if I had a ladder or now even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go, yeah

[Chorus]
Uh, I'm out for presidents to represent me, nigga
I'm out for presidents to represent me, yeah
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
Warm Up
Yeah, Warm Up
Yeah, Warm Up
This is The Warm Up
[Verse 2]
Ayy, look
Heaven or hell, you choose, freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop, I'm as hot as the devil's shoes
Overcame a low-life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these ho-like rappers, my whole life practice
To be the one, what's it like to be LeBron?
They calling you the savior, so much pressure, but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders, but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil' nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook, still niggas'll grill, no Foreman
Try not to call them ladies bees, but them hoes swarmin'
Now, honey, ayy, is it destiny or is it money you're feelin'?
Heard rumors of a deal and now you're thinkin' a million
Pardon my paranoid mind, but I'm starin' in the mirror
Livin' in fear that things'll never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself 'cause I asked for this
Headed for fame, but in my brain, hey, can I last in this?
Ayy, five years, I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehashin' shit
Jackin' styles, you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they tryna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm tryna live it how no other nigga ever lived it

[Chorus]
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
The Warm Up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, The Warm Up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, The Warm Up, ayy
[Outro]
Yeah, Fayettenam, nigga, yeah
Ayy, Carolina all day
Yeah
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me, hey
