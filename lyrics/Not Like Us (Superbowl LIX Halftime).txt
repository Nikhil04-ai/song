Title: Not Like Us (Superbowl LIX Halftime)
Artist: kendrick lamar
[Intro]
Oh
 no
It's a cultural divide, I'ma get it on the floor
You
 really 'bout to do it?
Forty acres and a mule, this is bigger than the music
You really 'bout to do it?
Yeah, they tried to rig the game, but you can't fake influence
Then get on it like that
Ayy, I'm trippin', I'm slidin', I'm ridin' through the back like, "Baow"
[Verse]
Mustard on the beat, bro
Deebo any rap, uh, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe"
Nail them boys to the cross, they walk around like Teez'
What's up with these jabroni-O, uh, tryna see Compton?
Industry can hate me, bump 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
Finna crash on this body, I'm John Stockton
What? Beat your— and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho
Pole, extort sh—, bully Death Row
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any— that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
Party at the party playin' with his nose now
Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified—
 (
Christ
)
(Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop) I'm on 'em tough
(Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop) I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a—? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor

[Chorus]
They not like us (No), they not like us (No), they not like us (What?)
They not like us (No), they not like us (No), they not like us
[Outro]
Are you my friend?
Are we locked in?
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way, hol' on
