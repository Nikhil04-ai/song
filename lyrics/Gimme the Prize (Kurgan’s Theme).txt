Title: Gimme the Prize (Kurgan’s Theme)
Artist: Queen
 
[Intro: Female Announcer & 
Clancy Brown
]
In the garage and water
From the sprinklers
It also left a man's decapitated body
Lying on the floor
Next to his own severed head
A head which at this time
Has no name
I know his name...
[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Here I am
I'm the master of your destiny
Ha-ha
[Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Give me the prize
Just give me the prize
[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
Give me your kings
Let me squeeze them in my hands
(He-he-hey)
Your puny princes
Your so-called leaders of your land
I'll eat them whole before I'm done
The battle's fought and the game is won

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & 
Clancy Brown
]
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Give me the prize
Just give me the prize 
(The prize)
[Skit: Clancy Brown]
Hahahahahaha
Hahahahahaha
Now you die!
Ahahahahahaha!
I have something to say
It's better to burn out
Than to fade away
There can be only one!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3: Freddie Mercury]
Move over, I said move over
Hey, hey, hey, clear the way
There's no escape from my authority
Didn't I tell you?
[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & 
Clancy Brown
]
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Give me the prize 
(The prize)
Just give me the prize 
(The prize)

[Outro: Freddie Mercury & 
Christopher Lambert
]
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
So give me the prize
There can be only one!
