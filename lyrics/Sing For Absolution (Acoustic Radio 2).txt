Title: Sing For Absolution (Acoustic Radio 2)
Artist: Muse
[Verse 1]
Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful
Tiptoe to your room
A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you
And you never knew
[Chorus]
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace
[Verse 2]
There's nowhere left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die
Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful
[Chorus]
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace

[Chorus]
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace
[Outro]
Our wrongs remain unrectified
And our souls won't be exhumed
