Want your bad romance
Ra-ra-ah-ah-ah

Want your bad romance
[Verse 1]
I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it’s free
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love (Hey!)
I want your drama, the touch of your hand (Hey!)
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
(Love, love, love, I want your love)
[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad
Your bad romance

[Chorus]
I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I want your love, and all your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught in a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught in a bad romance

I want your horror, I want your design
'Cause you’re a criminal as long as you’re mine

I want your psycho, your vertigo shtick
Want you in my rear window, baby, it's sick
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love

You know that I want you
And you know that I need you (cause I'm a free bitch, baby)
