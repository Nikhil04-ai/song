Title: SCIFI
Artist: Kanye West
 
[Intro: Kim Kardashian]
I married the best rapper of all time
Not only that, he's the richest Black man in America
A talented, legit genius who gave me four incredible kids
[Verse 1: Sean Leon]
Let me not, let me not
I better not, it'd be best if I stop
Let me not, go **** apeshit, full BAPE
I was down, no e— (Yeah, yeah)
I was down, no escape
I was down, ain't no escape, there's no escape
Lupe out my town, had to skate (Skate, kick, push)
Wе just said goodbye, but it's straight (But it's straight, ayy)
I **** with her vibe, it's okay (It's okay, ayy)
Got mе hypnotized, in a daze
Protect my mind
Protectin' what's mine
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice, oxygen or Wi-Fi?
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice, oxygen or Wi-Fi?
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Don't they know? And then they'll know
That's not all
When you lay down and I gave you the semen
I swear I heard God, the voice of Morgan Freeman (Freeman)
Baby, bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye
Baby, bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye
I'm just going to remove myself
From the situation 'fore I lose myself
From the situation 'fore I lose my health
I can't control you, but I could lose myself

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice, oxygen or Wi-Fi?
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice already, oxygen or Wi-Fi?
