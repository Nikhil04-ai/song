Title: Rain Must Fall
Artist: Queen
Â 
[Verse 1]
I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious
Honey
[Chorus]
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life
A little rain must fall
[Post-Chorus]
No problem, uh
Be cool, now
[Verse 2]
Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price
Honey

[Chorus]
You found success and recognition
But into every life
A little rain must fall
Flow John!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life
A little rain must fall
[Post-Chorus]
Be cool
Ha!
Kiss, kiss
[Verse 3]
Others seem to think
You are over dramatizing
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions, honey

[Chorus]
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cause into every life
A little rain must fall
[Post-Chorus]
Be cool, get this
Woo! Alright
[Outro]
Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool, yeah
Yes, baby
Ooh, one more time
Uh-huh, I like it
Make it rain
