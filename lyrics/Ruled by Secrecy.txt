Title: Ruled by Secrecy
Artist: Muse
Â 
[Verse 1]
Repress and restrain
Steal the pressure and the pain
Wash the blood off your hands
This time she won't understand
[Chorus]
Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control
[Verse 2]
You're working so hard
And you're never in charge
Your death creates success
Rebuild and suppress
[Chorus]
Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control
[Piano Solo]
[Chorus]
Change in the air
And they'll hide everywhere
And no one knows who's in control

[Outro]
