Title: Run Rudolph Run
Artist: Norah Jones 
Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind
Run run Rudolph Randolph ain't too far behind
Run run Rudolph Santa's gotta make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph 'cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Said Santa to a little girl what have you been longin' for
All I want for Christmas is a rock n' roll electric guitar
And then away went Rudolph whizzin' like a shootin' star
Run run Rudolph Santa's gotta make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round
Said Santa to a little boy what have you been longin' for
All he wants for Christmas is a rock n' roll electric guitar
And then away went Rudolph whizzin' like a shootin' star
Run run Rudolph Santa's gotta make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down
I said run run Rudolph I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
