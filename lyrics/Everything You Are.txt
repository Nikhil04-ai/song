Title: Everything You Are
Artist: Ed Sheeran
[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to break your heart, I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight?
I wish I never called you up, and nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
And won't you just hold me tonight?
[Pre-Chorus]
And I will stop trying to fall in love again and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
'Cause you are the only one for me, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Oh, maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are

[Verse 2]
I never meant to sleep around, I was just lonely
And you did the same, again and again and again, woah, I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I will stop trying to fall in love again and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
'Cause you are the only one for me, hmm, yeah
[Chorus]
And maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Oh, maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are
[Bridge]
When I see my future, it is with you
And we'll get there
And I want my children to be with you
And we'll get there, hmm, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Oh, maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are
[Outro]
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are
