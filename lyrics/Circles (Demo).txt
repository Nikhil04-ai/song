[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell her throw that ass in a circle
Throw that ass in a circle (Ooh, yeah)
Dolla show what that work do
Tell her throw that ass in a circle (Ooh, yeah)
Tell her throw that ass in a circle, yeah
Geeked up, bitch, Urkel
She gon' throw that ass in a circle, yeah
Throw that ass in a circle
She gon' throw it back for a boss (Boss)
Look back for a boss (Boss)
Make it clap for a boss (Boss)
Clean it up for a boss
Gettin' head in my drawers
Gettin' head with my drawers on
Private flight like a boss
Maserati like a boss, ayy, yeah
[Post-Chorus: Pusha T]
Put you in all the designer
If you keep me high, be my supplier
See, she like playin' with fire
Meet you anywhere as long as you fly her (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Throw that ass in a circle, now
Show me how you been workin' now
I just wanna be certain now
Surgery's the new workin' out
Love the way that you perkin' out
Compliments to your surgeon now
Ain't no need to be nervous now
Know the cost of these Birkins? Ow
Never had a problem with it
I just tally up the digits
He count it by the band
I just count it by the midget
If we on the same accord
I'll take you out your Honda Civic
And they just like to talk about it
I just rap it 'cause I live it (Woo)
