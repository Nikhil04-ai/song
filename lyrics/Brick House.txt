[Chorus]
Ow, she's a brickhouse
She's mighty mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
Ow, she's a brickhouse
Ah, like lady's stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back
Ow, she's a brickhouse
Well, we're together everybody knows
This is how the story goes
[Verse 1]
She knows she's got everything
That a woman needs to get a man, yeah yeah
How can she lose with what she use
36-24-36, ow, what a winning hand
[Chorus]
Ow, she's a brickhouse
She's mighty mighty, just letting it all hang out
Aye, she's a brickhouse
Ow, like lady's stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back
Ow, she's a brickhouse
Yeah, she's the one, the only one
Whos built like an amazon

[Verse 2]
The clothes she wears, the sexy ways
Make an old man wish for younger days, yeah yeah
She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sure enough to knock a strong man to his knees
[Chorus]
'Cause she's a brickhouse
Yeah, she's mighty mighty, just letting it all hang out
Aye, a brickhouse
Ah, like lady's stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back, ow
[Bridge][2x]
Shake it down, shake it down now [3x]
Shake it down, shake it do-do-down
[Chorus]
Brickhouse
Yeah, she's mighty mighty, just letting it all hang out
Brickhouse
Yeah, she's the one, the only one
Whos built like an amazon, yeah
[Bridge]

[Chorus]
