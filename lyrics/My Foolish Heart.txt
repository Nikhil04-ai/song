Title: My Foolish Heart
Artist: Frank Sinatra
Frank Sinatra recorded the song in 1988, making it his last solo recording.
The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart!
How white the ever distant moon, take care, my foolish heart!
There's a line between love and fascination
That's so hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss
Her lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart!
But should our eager lips combine, then let that fire start
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart!
[Instrumental]
Her lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart!
But should our eager lips combine, then let that fire start
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart!
This time, it's love, my foolish heart!
