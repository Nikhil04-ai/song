Artist: Ed Sheeran
Lyrics From 
Live Debut in Ipswich, Massachusetts
[Verse 1]
You're glowing, you colour and fracture the light
You can't help but shine
And I know that you carry the world on your back
But look at you tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
The lights, your face, your eyes
Exploding like fireworks in the sky
[Chorus]
Sapphire
Touchin' on your body while you're pushin' on me
Don't you end the party, I can do this all week
We'll be dancin' till the morning, go to bed, we won't sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare vargee
Sapphire
Touchin' on your body while you're pushin' on me
Don't you end the party, I can do this all week
We'll be dancin' till the morning, go to bed, we won't sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare vargee
Sapphire
[Verse 2]
Look what we found, Karma reached out
Into our hearts and pulled us to our feet now
You know, the truth is we could disappear
Anywhere, as long as I got you there
When the sun dies, till the day shines
'Cause when I'm with you, there's not enough time
You are my spring flower, watchin' you bloom while
We are surrounded, but I can only see

[Pre-Chorus]
The lights, your face, your eyes
Exploding like fireworks in the sky
[Chorus]
Sapphire
Touchin' on your body while you're pushin' on me
Don't you end the party, I can do this all week
We'll be dancin' till the morning, go to bed, we won't sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare vargee
Sapphire
Touchin' on your body while you're pushin' on me
Don't you end the party, I can do this all week
We'll be dancin' till the morning, go to bed, we won't sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare vargee
Sapphire
[Bridge]
You're glowing
You're glowing
You colour and fracture the light
Look at you tonight
[?]
Cham cham chamke sitare vargee
[Chorus]
Sapphire
Touchin' on your body while you're pushin' on me
Don't you end the party, I can do this all week
We'll be dancin' till the morning, go to bed, we won't sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare vargee
Sapphire
Touchin' on your body while you're pushin' on me
Don't you end the party, I can do this all week
We'll be dancin' till the morning, go to bed, we won't sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare vargee
Sapphire

[Outro]
The lights, your face, your eyes exploding
Like fireworks in the sky

The lights, your face, your eyes exploding
Like fireworks in the sky
(
Sapphire

The lights, your face, your eyes exploding
Like fireworks in the sky
