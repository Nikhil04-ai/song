Title: Part Of Me
Artist: Harry styles
[Verse 1]
Cameron called to tell me
He saw you falling over
I guess you still can’t hold your red wine
I always could hold you though
Corsica
, Morocco
The way that dress adores you, sunshine
Cause you like a certain life
Spending money all the time
You’re so fancy on the eyes
But you’ve been told too many times
You can’t do the things you like
Cause you’re easy on the eyes
[Chorus]
There’s a part of me
No one ever sees
Cause I’ll always bе
A little in between
Would’ve givеn you everything
But you took a little piece
And that part of me
Is yours to keep
Part of me is yours
[Verse 2]
You found someone like you though
Found a man named Theo
Worked out for the best now don’t you see
I just hope you know it
Cause I still love the moment all the same
You don’t like a modern life
So can we just go back in time
To a red route ‘65

[Chorus]
There’s a part of me
No one ever sees
Cause I’ll always be
A little in between
Would’ve  given you everything
But you took a little piece
And that part of me
Is yours to keep
Part of me is yours
[Chorus]
There’s a part of me
No one ever sees
Cause I’ll always be
A little in between
When I finally find it
I’ll jump in with both my feet
But that part of me
Is yours to keep
Part of me is yours only
That part of me is yours
