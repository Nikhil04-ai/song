Title: Better Left Unsaid
Artist: Ariana Grande
 
[Verse 1]
I told you once, "Get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright"
But some things are better left unsaid (Said, said)
To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid (Said, said)
[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said
[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah-oh
I'm gonna say things
Like, "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh-woah-woah-oh
Tonight, I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh-woah-woah-oh
Tonight, I'll say things
Don't play me (Oh), just kiss me, babe

[Verse 2]
I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons that
Some things are better left unsaid (Said, said)
[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said
[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah-oh
I'm gonna say things
Like, "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh-woah-woah-oh
Tonight, I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh-woah-woah-oh
Tonight, I'll say things
Don't play me (Oh), just kiss me, babe
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh-woah-woah-oh
Tonight, I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe

[Bridge]
Oh-woah-woah-oh (
If you wanna party, put your hands up, put your hands—
)
Oh-woah-woah-oh (
If you wanna party, put your hands up, put your hands—
)
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah (
If you wanna party, put your hands up, put your hands up
)
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
[Outro]
I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons that
Some things are better left unsaid (Said, said)
