Title: Vice City
Artist: Crush
[Verse 1: Pouya]
Baby Bone never wanted to be alone, yuh
Baby Bone never wanted a fucking throne, yuh
That bread is what I gotta focus on, but if the shoe fit, I'ma wear it
Spit it out your mouth, don’t be embarrassed
Time is money, can't be moving like I'm Gary, life so scary
Everybody carry guns, everybody on drugs
Everybody suicidal but got nowhere to run
Who gives a therapist therapy? Think I might need me one
I’m an insomniac with a gambling problem, throwin' my life away
Fuckin' hoes with no condoms until my dick evaporate
Mask on but no masquerade
She love to hear my voice every time she wanna masturbate
Buffet Boys up in your bitch, boy
[Verse 2: Boobie Lootaveli]
I just caught the flu, sittin' inside of the coupe
Whip my hair out, fuck the roof, titties out like Betty Boop
And my pockets got a lotta loot, pocket rocket, too
If you sat inside my shoes, ho, you wouldn't know what to do
[Verse 3: Pouya]
Yuh, I'm rollin' through my city with my limo-tinted windows
And nobody can see in it, used to pull up in a Civic, wait a minute
Quit your bitchin', bitch, and I’ma slide my dick up in it
Less than a minute, I’m cool, I'm good, I’m straight, I'm finished

[Verse 4: Boobie Lootaveli]
Bitch, get in your bag, like the rabbit in the hat do
Swervin' in a hoopty with them babies blowin' past you
No, I didn’t juug you, lil' bitch, but I plan to
Pussy talkin' shit behind the keyboard in a chat room
I'm just chasin' goals and catchin' bags along the way
If you try me, catch a semi-automatic to your face
I might go and rent a boat and leave it anchored for the day
Just to pull up with my gang 'cause we just wanna celebrate
Split that shit up like a Kit Kat with my partner, 'bout my business
Why you ain't get no money, but you sittin' out here bitchin'?
Lil' bitch, I'm a trapper, I don't care about no pension, man
Somebody call the cops because my roof is going missin'
