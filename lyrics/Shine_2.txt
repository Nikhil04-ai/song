Title: Shine
Artist: Muse
Â 
[Verse 1]
Who cares for the life we've earned
Someone sold all the truth you yearned
Remember when you used to shine?
And had no fear or sense of time
When it creeps up on you
[Verse 2]
You can't cry now, there's nothing to feel
No one's noticed our loneliness
Remember when you should have teased
And made us scream eternal joy
[Verse 3]
I believed that you'd always be here
Cause once you'd promised a life with no fear
Please don't break my ideals
And say what's fake was always real
Hope was the one, now I'm gone
Take me back again
