Title: Teen Summit Freestyle
Artist: The Notorious B.I.G.
[Verse]
Alright, alright, yo
The B.I.G. is far from a chump
I love to thump, I'm so rump I got
Kriss-Kross jump
I like the beats that thump
The Cherokee, the Pathfinder jeeps
Peace to Fulton Street when I compete
MCs take flight like Clyde The Glide Drexler
Try to flex, I suplex ya, huh
It's me, you know my pedigree
Rhymes and beats so fat leave the mess with Dick Gregory
Who got props like Biggie Smalls got props?
Nobody, hops
Nobody drops words off the top of the head
My metaphors are sharp like cheddar cheese
Blowing MCs out with ease
Homie please!
I like to max in Maximas and Acuras
Your girls buttcheeks I'm smackin, huh
MCs have a hard time believin'
I'm marked for death, hard to kill like Steven
Bad Boy in the house!
