Title: Rains in Heaven
Artist: NCT Dream
[Verse 1: Mark, 
Jeno
, 
Chenle
, 
Renjun
]
In the morning when you wake up
Thinking 'bout how you wanna run away from here
Wanna cry and disappear
There's something that you need to hear
Every night you become my sky
'Cause one glance, it ain't ever enough
You don't believe it
There's something that you need to see
[Pre-Chorus: Haechan, 
Jisung
, 
Chenle
]
Ooh, yeah, it's your reflection
Clouds up in heaven
They have a message for you and me
I know that you feel alone
I know that you lost all hope
But I'm always, I am always
Always by your side
[Chorus: All, 
Renjun
]
We are all the same but hurt different
I heard when you cry, it rains in heaven
I won't let you fall down
Unless you're in my arms
Only in my arms
Keep your heart with me, let me read it
All your tears remind me you're beautiful
It won't change how I think
I love the way you are
The way you are (
The way you are
)

[Verse 2: Jaemin, 
Jisung
, 
Jeno
, 
Haechan & Jisung
, *Mark*, **Renjun**]
Yeah, I said now, take it step by step (
Oh
)
Say onto the next, oh
And dream with no regrets
 (
No regrets
)
Hold on, never let go
, 
uh
I wanna hold you
Girl, I adore you
Just let me show you
*Let your heaven shine through*
*Let's go* (**Oh-oh**)
[Pre-Chorus: Chenle, 
Haechan
, 
Renjun
, 
Jisung
, *Mark*]
We ain't ever looking back, looking back, no (
No
)
Don't let any of our past chase us down, you know
 (*Oh, yeah*)
We're more than what we're made to think
 (
We're made to think
)
Time to believe
 (Ooh, yeah)
[Chorus: All, 
Haechan
, 
Chenle
, 
Renjun
]
We are all the same
 but hurt 
different, oh
I heard when you 
cry, it rains in heaven
(
I won't let
) I won't let you fall down
Unless you're in my arms (
Oh, in my arms
)
Only in my arms
Keep your heart with me, 
let me read it, oh
All your tears remind me you're beautiful (
Me you're beautiful
)
It won't change (
It won't
) how I think (
How I
)
I love the way you are
The way you are (
The way you are
)

[Bridge: Mark, 
Jeno
, 
Jaemin
, 
All
, *Haechan*]
Yeah
Remember the reason to love (
To love
)
Tell me that you won't give up (
You won't, yeah
)
Crawl then we walk, so we run (
We run
)
Get off the ground, go up higher and higher now
Uh, falling like a shooting star
 (
A star
)
Catch you anywhere you are
 (
You are
)
You ain't even gotta call
*'Cause I'll be there*
[Chorus: All, 
Haechan
, 
Chenle
, 
Renjun
]
We are all the same but hurt different (
Ah
)
I heard when you 
cry, it rains in heaven, no, oh-oh
I won't let 
you fall down
Unless you're in my arms (
You're in my arms
)
Only in my arms (
Ooh
)
Keep your heart with me, let me read it
All your tears remind me you're beautiful (
Remind me you're beautiful
)
It won't change how I think
I love the way you are (
Yeah
)
The way you are (
Are
)
