Title: Bad One
Artist: Eminem
Â 
[Intro: Eminem]
Yo, Dre, yeah
I'ma just lay back on this one
Let me apologize in advance (I like that)
Fuck it, forgive me (Alright)
Fuck it, I don't mean to sound (You ready?) arrogant (Fuck it, yeah), but
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yeah, my head up in the sky again (Woo)
But even that, my stacks are higher than
Money pile like Tony Stark's
That's how much I earn, man (Damn)
Girl, my head is swole, I feel incredible as the Hulk
Meaning I'm trying to smash (Haha, woo)
So come get in line like Santa
And climb up inside my lap (Come on)
While I devise a plan (Kidnap)
Won't be talkin' about Purell (Yeah)
When Santa ties your hands (Haha)
And I am an industrial-strength high-end brand frying pan
Rap is something that I've just had the skill at for some time, and am
An artist who can draw a crowd like a diagram (Yeah)
Like drawing breath from your diaphragm
I've achieved every aspiration that I have had
Got a diamond plaque or two, or three, or four
But that don't change my attitude

[Chorus: White Gold,

Ayy, 
I got a bad one
She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum
You just gotta 
put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond
I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now
I love all of my records, but she said 
I got a bad one
She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum
You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond
I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now
I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one (
Yeah
)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
One minute, you're here, next minute, you're gone, don't sit there and scoff
Lil' bitch, you can knock the shit about me being immature off
It isn't my fault, the liquor is often twisting my thoughts
You said you're looking for miniature golf (Yeah)
Thought you said, "Looking for men to jerk off" (Haha)
Your mouth is a hole (What?), that means my dick is engulfed
Sick as a dog with croup cough
 (What?)
Biggie is gone and 2Pac (Yeah)
And I'm still alive and you not the Wu, dog
So who died and made you God? (Fuck, bitch)
Anything can set my mood off, attitude, I've always had one
My temper's like the bitch I just scooped up
[Chorus: White Gold,

Ayy, 
I got a bad one
She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum
You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond
I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now
I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one
She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum
You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond
I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now
I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, this whole subgenre with all these corny white rappers, I'm not a fan of it (You suck)
It ain't my fault, but like sock puppets, I had a hand in it
This thousand bucks in my hand is just like what Candace did
When she turned her back on her own race 'cause I have abandoned it
One of the greatest who did it, look what I came up through
You never made it to the level that I made it to
So similar to a dinner table, I ate at you (Sorry)
Haters, I made a few
But like when Three Stacks just plays the flute
I ain't got shit to say to you (Nah)
And me offending you's nothing new (Nah)
Fuck it, it's what I love to do
This is subterfuge, just to screw with you
And yeah, this much is true
This sounds like something that Puff would do
At a party with Aaron Hall 'cause I just love to fuck with you (Woah)
Eyeliner, blush, foundation kit
'Cause it's you I make upset
Brain is dead, space cadet
Like when Ye forgets to take his meds
So when they get mad or angry at
A statement that I may have said
I just say, "Man, I didn't say that shit, Shady did"
'Cause all I do is write the rhymes and then wait for that beat to play, spit 'em
Trigger finger, make like a 
green beret
 like he would get a submachine to spray with 'em
I should go back to those sleeping aids
Because I'm so stuck in my evil ways
Then I'm fucked either way
The people still seem to think that they want the old me 'til they get him
Got 'em up in arms like monkey bars
The fucking bomb, word to Puffy, I'm
I'm blowing up like Kid Cudi's car
In front of his house where all his buddies are
Just another day at the office, but it seems like Marsh's fucking job is done
Mission accomplished, he pulled off his stunt
And pissed a billion people off at once (Yeah)
But I gotta keep going Tyson on Kelly (What?)
I bodied him twice and already
That little motherfucker's back throwing subs (Like what?) like a food fight at the deli
And that is why E got the attitude he got like Liza Minnelli
My male ego is the size of the belly on Jelly Roll and, bitch

[Chorus: White Gold, 
White Gold & Eminem

I got a bad one
She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum
You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond
I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now
I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one
She just gotta put up with my shit, I'm going platinum
You just gotta put up with my wrist, I'm going diamond
I just put Fidel up on the link, I'm going gold now
I love all of my records, but she said I got a bad one
