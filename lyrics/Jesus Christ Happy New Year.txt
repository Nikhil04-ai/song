Artist: Harry styles
[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-aah
Ooh, ooh-aah
[Verse 1]
All you dreamers won’t die (ooh, ooh-aah)
Feel no fear you’re older now (ooh, ooh-aah)
Keeping the freeze of the cold air out (ooh, ooh-aah)
You’ve been having the time of your life (ooh, ooh-aah)
So celebrate
[Chorus 1]
Here we go again
There goes another year
I don’t feel at home anymore
But at least I made a couple friends
There goes another year
Went over my head
Jesus we can talk through the door
I don’t wanna come in anyway
[Verse 2]
Well I was awake at the start of the world
And I’ll be alone in the back of a hearse
There’s no stopping me now (ain't no stopping, stopping me now)
There’s just no stopping me now (ain't no stopping me now)
There's just no stopping me now (ain't no stopping me now)
There's just no stopping me (ain't no stop-)

[Chorus 2]
Here we go again
There goes another year
Maybe we don’t talk anymore
But at least we can be kinda friends
There goes another year
Went over my head
Jesus we can talk through the door
I don’t wanna come in anyway
But I know that I’ll be back again
I’m coming back again
Hey
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh-aah
Ooh, ooh-aah
Ooh, ooh-aah
Ooh, ooh-aah
