Title: GIMME SUM MOAR
Artist: Doja Cat
[Intro]
You know this more though, ah
Yuh, yuh, welcome to my kingdom
Bitch, aha-haha, yuh
Y'all know who it is, y'all know who the fuck this is, yuh
[Chorus]
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
[Verse 1]
Yuh, I want more though, you can import those
Bitches runnin' for they money like toro
I can't afford boring hoes, so I pour more
In my poly, paper cup, AriZona tea-bag a bitch
Make her save her nuts, backyard, acre'd up
That broad, save her up, pink duck, red whites
Glass light, Remy in a glass pipe
Puff, puff, pass, light, right here, see me in a light year
Pretty, kitty-cat rest, snow white, tight year (Yuh)
Make you wanna pull up on that tail like a kite steer
This pussy neat, this pussy fancy
That pussy weak, that pussy Bambi
Smoke a little weed, bitch, I'm feeling dandy
Lion in the jungle, screamin' like a Banshee
Aaaaah! (
Huh, huh, huh!
)

[Chorus]
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
[Verse 2]
Yuh, my eyes find China, I cry to the fine diners
Got the munchies, nigga, I'm higher than flight mileage
A ounce of the OG, a bump of a white spider
That jumps at the nose, freezes and melts your septum entirely
I been highly admiring models with tolerancy
And all of them fry the kin in the club like they knocking 8-balls
In pits in your boss' pocket, clit, gun, cock it
You get one shot, if you can twist my knowledge
B-B-B-Brain cloud under my bone cave
I'm wondering what could make my troubles just go away
I'm bumpin' it for the pain, I'm bumpin' it for the day
And if I do it tomorrow, I'm prolly goin' insane, like (
Huh, huh, huh!
)
[Chorus]
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more
I want it all, gimme some more
Gimme some more, gimme, gimme some more

[Outro]
Aaaaaaaah!
