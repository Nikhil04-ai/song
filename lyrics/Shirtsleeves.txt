Title: Shirtsleeves
Artist: Ed Sheeran
Â 
[Verse 1]
I can taste salt water
And if I blink again, you'll be sinkin' in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya and you'll think of him
And pretty soon, you'll be floating away
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
[Chorus]
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
[Verse 2]
I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss, bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your makeup
I'll never trust you again, you can just be a friend

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat, love
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
[Chorus]
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
[Bridge]
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is, I
I'm on my way home, I'm on the way home
I lied, I tried to cry, but I'm
I'm drownin' in the oceans you made
[Chorus]
When salted tears won't dry
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
