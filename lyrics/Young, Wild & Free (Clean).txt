Title: Young, Wild & Free (Clean)
Artist: Snoop Dogg
[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Is this thing on? Word
[Chorus: Bruno Mars & 
Wiz Khalifa
]
So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
We don’t care who sees
So what? We go out (
Ayy, let me get a lighter, please
)
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free (
Keep the L in there
)
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real, if y'all don't know me
Keep it player for these bros
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll up bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And burn them things down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your chick smokin’ grade A
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Upfront, four (four), like, “Khalifa put the *ding* in a J”

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
We don’t care who sees
So what? We go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & 
Snoop Dogg
]
And I don't even care
'Long as me and my team in there
There's gon' be some green in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, **** as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
We don’t care who sees
So what? We go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we're all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we're all just having fun
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what? We get drunk
So what? We don't sleep
We’re just havin' fun
And we don’t care who sees
So what? We go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
We don’t care who sees
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
