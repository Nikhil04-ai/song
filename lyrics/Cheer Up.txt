Title: Cheer Up
Artist: J.Cole
J Cole’s inspirational call to all the girls from fucked-up families.
[Intro]
Hey, uh, hey, uh
[Chorus]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know, huh
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
[Verse 1]
Yeah, school girl, cool girl
You dressin' sexy and your mama is a cougar
So she let you do the grown folks thang
Let you hang with them boys and they play you like a fool, girl
You got your new hair, it look so good
You write the same nigga's name in your notebook
You know the same one from class, the one you let smash
Now you see him 'round school and he won't look
Now girl you is fine, ain't no doubt about it
But why else you think he hit it and forgot about it?
That's 'cause your mind don't match what your ass got
But cheer up, you gotta be your own mascot
You see you're lookin' for a man like you need somebody
Get your ass off of Twitter, you could be somebody
A doctor, a rock star, baby live life
But you rather wet up all your pillows all night thinking...

[Chorus]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know, huh
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know, uh
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, uh, that's all I...
[Post Chorus]
Hey cheer up! Uh
Ey lil' mama, cheer up! Uh
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up? Uh
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Hey, hey
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
Don't even wanna get out the bed
I got the Glock to my head, feel I rather be dead
Hey, am I hopeless? 
Raised with rats and roaches
Never liked them teachers, couldn't stand my coaches
Ask "what's the matter?" but you can't relate
Living a life that you hate but you can't escape
Feel like I’m stuck here, that's why I don't give a fuck here
There's no luck here, nobody to trust here
My own mother, yeah I love her
But things I heard as a child under my covers
Left me with scars, it was hard to see her suffer
Darkened my heart and I don't know if I’ll recover
I'm going under
 
and as I'm headed out the front door
She said she proud of me and I wonder what for?
And once more

[Chorus]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know, huh
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know, uh
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, uh, that's all I...
[Post Chorus]
Hey cheer up! Uh
Ey lil' mama, cheer up! Uh
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up? Uh
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Hey, hey
