Title: So We Drift
Artist: Novo Amor 
[Verse 1]
Fore go this ritual of silence
My thoughts collapse me
Under go your habitual ways of violence
I'm strung up today
The night falls earlier these days
But the stars aren't as bright as they were in our old summer haze
[Verse 2]
Drifting away from me
My love will be waiting near so hungry
Throw away my necessities
And you will be in my past
The nights fall easier your way
But the stars aren't as bright as they were in our old summer haze
[Chorus]
Oh you're paramount and I'm just shallow now in your tides
Oh you're paramount, so leave me narrow and surmount my mind
And so we drift
[Verse 3]
Become individual
My vibrance is gone with the wind
We're numb, we have heard it all before
Our silence escapes your thoughts
And the night falls earlier these days
But the stars aren't as bright as they were in our old summer haze

[Chorus]
Oh you're paramount and I'm just shallow now in your tides
Oh you're paramount, so leave me narrow and surmount my mind
Oh you're paramount and I'm just shallow now in your tides
Oh you're paramount, so leave me narrow and surmount my mind
And so we drift
