Title: Overdue
Artist: Muse
[Verse 1]
You needed it when I was away
And no matter what I say
You'll never forget when I wasn't there
So why should I care?
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm young, but I know that I'm aroused
[Chorus]
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
[Verse 2]
It doesn't matter where I have gone
I just can't afford to
And pay for all the mistakes that you have made
It's about time I was paid
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm young, but I know that I'm aroused
[Chorus]
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
You know that I care
You should have been there
