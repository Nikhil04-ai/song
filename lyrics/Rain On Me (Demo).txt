Title: Rain On Me (Demo)
Artist: Lady Gaga
 
[Intro]
Oh
[Verse 1]
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I didn't ask for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Water like misery
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) I'm ready, rain on me
[Chorus]
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain, rain
[Post-Chorus]
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain

[Verse 2]
I didn't ask for the daylight
'Cause I was born for the night, and it changed my life
I knew the hurt wouldn't be small
You said you'd love me forever, but you don't call
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Water like misery
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) It's coming down on me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) I'm ready, rain on me
[Chorus]
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
[Post-Chorus]
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me

Rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain on me, rain, rain (Rain)
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
[Outro]
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain
