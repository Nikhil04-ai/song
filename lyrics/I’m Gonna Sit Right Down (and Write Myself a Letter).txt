Title: Iâ€™m Gonna Sit Right Down (and Write Myself a Letter)
Artist: Frank Sinatra
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words, oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em
I'm gonna smile and say, "I hope you're feeling better"
And close with "Love," the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe that it came from you
I'll be glad I got 'em
I'm gonna smile and say, "I hope you're feeling better"
And then I'll close with "Love," the way you do
I'm gonna sit down, write myself a letter
And make believe it came
Though I know it's not the same
I'll make believe it came from you
