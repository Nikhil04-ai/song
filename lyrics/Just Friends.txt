Title: Just Friends
Artist: Dua Lipa
Baby, my heart is aching
We can't cut ties, we're intertwined
Can't keep you at our place
We're magnetized, pushing side by side
Slow dancing with my heartstrings
The sun is slow like we can bring the rain
There's no time to love but love can turn to hate
Boy, it's been a pleasure had to change the pain
Should we go on or should we stay the same?
Just friends, just friends, just friends
Oh, no, you want to eyes like-
