Title: Oh, Round Lake
Artist: Novo Amor 
[Verse 1]
Oh, Round Lake
I've been wishing that I stayed
To carve my name
In Louisiana State
[Verse 2]
One long day
All my love will make you shake
I found my place
In a twisted rib cage
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Oh, Round Lake
For five years I've felt your break
With all my shame
I will watch you wash away
[Refrain]
I will watch you wash away
I will watch you wash away
[Verse 4]
Oh, Round Lake
I've been
Wishing you would take your place
In every scene

[Outro]
Oh, Round Lake, I need
Oh, Round Lake, serene
