Artist: Justin Bieber
Â 
[Intro]
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
[Verse 1]
Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly, the truth is...
[Chorus]
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

[Interlude]
Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy
(Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright)
But it sure is worth a try
(Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright)
[Verse 2]
Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this is a lesson, then baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do just to stay right next to you
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly, the truth is
[Chorus]
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

[Bridge]
Basically, I'm staying here
I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me, yeah
Ain't no need for contemplating
Promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me, baby, I'm all that you need
[Chorus]
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl
[Outro]
If I could die in your arms
I'ma make you believe girl
I wouldn't mind
Ay ay ay, oh
Don't stop, baby, no
It's what you do to me, yeah
Woah, no no no, ooh woah
Baby, please don't go, girl
Don't go, no no no
