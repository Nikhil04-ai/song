Title: Sail Away
Artist: Etta James
[Verse 1]
In America you get food to eat
Won't have to run through the jungle and scuff up your feet, no
You'll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day
It's great to be an American, yeah
[Verse 2]
Ain't no lions or tigers, ain't no mamba snakes
Just the sweet watermelon and a buckwheat cake
Everybody is happy as a man, as a man can be
Climb aboard, little wog, sail away with me, now c'mon now
[Chorus]
Sail away (Sail away), sail away (Sail away)
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
Sail away (Sail away), ah, sail away (Sail away)
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay (Ah)
[Verse 3]
In America every man is free, yeah
To take care of his home and his family
You'll be as happy as a monkey in a monkey tree
You're all gonna be an, an American, yeah, now come on in now
[Chorus]
Sail away (Sail away), sail away (Sail away)
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
Come on and sail away (Sail away), ooh, sail away (Sail away)
Ooh, we will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
Sail away (Sail away)
Sail away (Sail away), ooh, sail away, yeah
We will cross Charleston Bay
Now, sail away, sail away, yeah, sail away
We're gonna cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
Oh, sail away (Sail away), ah, sail away (Sail away)
We gonna cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
Sail away (Sail away), ooh, sail away, sail away, sail away (Sail away)
Oh, we're gonna cross it, we're gonna cross that bay (Charleston Bay)

[Outro]
Sail away, sail away (Sail away)
Sail away, sail away (Sail away), sail (Sail away)
Sail away, oh
