Title: Iâ€™m Going to Be a Teenage Idol
Artist: Elton John
[Verse 1]
Well, there's slim times when my words won't rhyme
And the hills I face are a long hard climb
I just sit cross-legged with my old guitar
Ooh, it kinda makes me feel like a rock 'n' roll star
[Verse 2]
Well, it makes me laugh, Lord, it makes me cry
And I think, for once, let me just get high
Let me get electric, put a silk suit on
Turn my old guitar into a tommy gun
[Bridge]
And root-toot-shoot myself to fame
Every kid alive gonna know my name
An overnight phenomenon like there's never been
A motivated supersonic king of the scene
[Chorus]
I'll be a teenage idol, just give me a break
I'm gonna be a teenage idol, no matter how long it takes
You can't imagine what it means to me
I'm going to grab myself a place in history
A teenage idol, ooh
That's what I'm gonna be
(Oh yeah)

[Verse 3]
Well, life is short and the world is rough
And if you're going to boogie, boy, you got to be tough
Nobody knows if I'm dead or alive
I just drink myself to sleep each night
[Verse 4]
And so I pray to the teenage god of rock
If I make it big, let me stay on top
You gotta cut me loose from this one-room dive
Put me on the ladder, keep this boy alive
[Bridge]
And root-toot-shoot myself to fame
Every kid alive gonna know my name
An overnight phenomenon like there's never been
A motivated supersonic king of the scene
[Chorus]
I'll be a teenage idol, just give me a break
I'm gonna be a teenage idol, no matter how long it takes
You can't imagine what it means to me
I'm going to grab myself a place in history
A teenage idol (Ha, yeah, ooh)
That's what I'm gonna be
