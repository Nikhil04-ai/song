Title: Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)
Artist: Elton John
This song was dedicated to John Lennon, a dear friend of Elton Johnâ€™s. He talks about how he wishes they could still be able to play music together.
[Verse 1]
What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden
Among the flagstones there
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect
Can damage so much grain
[Verse 2]
And what's it for?
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk
Nothin' grows no more
Who lived here?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed
We're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one
No one can replace
[Chorus]
And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'
Most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin'
"Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

[Verse 3]
And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger
If only he could hear
Who lived there?
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain
And with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name
[Chorus]
And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'
Most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin'
"Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"
[Chorus]
And I've been knockin'
But no one answers
And I've been knockin'
Most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin'
"Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out?
Can you come out to play?"

[Outro]
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
