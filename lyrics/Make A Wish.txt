Title: Make A Wish
Artist: Dua Lipa
Â 
[Chorus]
Baby, make a wish
You ain't never had it like this
Seal it with a kiss
I bet I'ma be your favorite
Baby, get a grip
See the honey drippin' on my lips
Come and get your fix
Come and get your fix, hey
[Pre-Chorus]
I heard that you can't handle someone like me
But I don't listen to the words that they've been sayin' about you
I'll teach you somethin' you can't live without
I'll freak you just like it's your birthday
[Chorus]
Baby, make a wish
You ain't never had it like this
Seal it with a kiss
I bet I'ma be your favorite
Baby, get a grip
See the honey drippin' on my lips
Come and get your fix, yeah
Come and get your fix, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You never seen a freak like me
Are you with it? Come and get it
You never seen a freak like me
I bet I'ma be your favorite
You never seen a freak like me
Are you with it? Come and get it
You never seen a freak like me
I bet I'ma be your favorite

I'll freak you just like it's your birthday

[Chorus]
Baby, make a wish
You ain't never had it like this
Seal it with a kiss
I bet I'ma be your favorite
Baby, get a grip
See the honey drippin' on my lips
Come and get your fix, yeah
Come and get your fix, yeah
