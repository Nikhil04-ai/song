[Verse 1]
Who's so phony and always surrounded?
Stop your screaming, no one can hear
All the scars on your skin post no bills
[Chorus]
Who you were
Was so beautiful
Remember who
Who you were
[Verse 2]
Hide from the mirror—the cracks and the memories
Hide from your family, they won't know you now
For all the holes in our souls host no thrills
[Chorus]
Who you were
Was so beautiful
Remember who
Who you were
