Title: Hard Time
Artist: Olivia Rodrigo
[Verse 1: Madison Hu & 
Olivia Rodrigo
]
Started when my parents got in it
Limited my digital time to ninety minutes
That's an outrage for someone my age
How's a girl like me supposed to handle her business?
Phone and tablet, they said to lose it
Why are we payin' for wifi if we ain't gonna use it?
It's a travesty the way they're cappin' me
I miss the nights when I sat up, postin' happily
Ninety minutes a night? Yo, you must be kiddin'
I'd like to text "S.O.S.," but that's forbidden
I'm in lockdown, I can't do anything
I'm connected to a soup can by a piece of string
[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo & Madison Hu]
Bizhardtime, I'm doin' hard time
Unfairly convicted of a screen crime
Bizhardtime, I hit my deadline
The minutes just expired on my phone line
[Verse 2: Madison Hu & 
Olivia Rodrigo
]
So many phone games from which they've banned me
I've got no dots, no zombies, no gems or candy
They say starin' at a screen isn't healthy
But can you tell me how I'm supposed to grab a selfie?
No clips of cats, or latest live streams
I'm missing all these dancing kids and dog memes
I've got my screen on hold and my ears on mute
They cut my game time in half like it was ninja fruit

[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo & Madison Hu]
Bizhardtime, I'm doin' hard time
Unfairly convicted of a screen crime
Bizhardtime, I hit my deadline
The clock just expired on my online
[Verse 3: Olivia Rodrigo & 
Madison Hu
]
On my profiles, I'm an absentee
My friends are gonna wonder what became of me
I've been evicted from social media
I'm doin' homework with dad's encyclopedia
I like to like, I love to comment
But the internet won't know, 'cause I'm not on it
Because I'm shut down, cut off from mobile
I can't tell if anybody liked my profile
I'm not givin' up, you can't stop me
I'll use Bizhardtime constructively
[Outro: Olivia Rodrigo &

Like, I hear there's a whole world out there besides the virtual one
Can I adjust the brightness?
Yeah, it's called sunglasses
These books are even more interesting than text messages
And they come fully charged
What are you doing?
I'm writing a note to this cool guy I met
With paper? That's so vintage
