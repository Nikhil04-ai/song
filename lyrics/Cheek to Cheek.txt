Title: Cheek to Cheek
Artist: Frank Sinatra
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancin' cheek to cheek
Oh, I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't boot me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh, I love to go out fishin'
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through
To Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find that happiness I seek
When we're out together swinging cheek to cheek

Come on and dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through
Right up to Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find that happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing
Out together dancing
Out together dancing cheek to cheek
