Title: Sad Tune For Your Friday Night*
Artist: Olivia Rodrigo
Lyrics from Snippet:
[Verse]
I know I'm a stop on the way to your soulmate
I'll fill you up, but only while you wait
You're everything to me, I see my future in your eyes
But I know when you're kissing me that you're just killing time
[Chorus]
It's okay, I know my place
I know I'm a stop on the way
To your soulmate
Ah, ah, ooh, ooh
