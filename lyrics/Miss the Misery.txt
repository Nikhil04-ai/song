Title: Miss the Misery
Artist: Foo Fighters
[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
If I had my way, if I had to lose
Wouldn't take back one thing, never had much to choose
Then it dawned on me, comin' down on you
Like a cold sky rainin' under a burnin' moon
Been waitin' all your life, your wish is comin' true
Bless your heart for beatin' me right out of you
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to explain
So turn it on again
[Chorus]
Don't change your mind
You're wastin' light
Get in and let's go-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
What a nice long leash, what a nice tight noose
Never worked for me, but sure would look good on you
Been waitin' all your life, your wish is comin' true
Bless your heart for beatin' me right out of you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to refrain
So turn it on again
[Chorus]
Don't change your mind
You're wastin' light
Get in and let's go-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
Miss the misery
Give me reason for a change
Miss the misery
Give me reason to refrain
Miss your misery today
Miss your misery today
Come on and turn it on for me!
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Don't change your mind
You're wastin' light
Don't make this right
Don't make this right
Get in and let's go-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh
