Yeah, yeah

hustler

 & 
50 Cent & Rileyy Lanez

I know heartbreaks, setbacks
Bitch, if I crap out, I'm sure I'ma get back
I been through the ups and downs, you know I get around
So to me, it's all a part of the game (
Ah, ah, yeah
)
If I ain't the coke man, or the dope man
I'm almost for sure man, I gotta take it
No need to say shit, I'm gon' take it
 (
Yeah, yeah
)
Robberies turned homicide, it's nothin' to play with

Make money, make-make, make money
When shit hit the fan, we'll take money, Southsidе
Beef with the best of 'em, donе shot at the rest of 'em (Yeah)
Checks, I'm collectin' 'em, check, boy, I'm finessin' em (Haha, 
oh, oh
)
Big bags of bread, boy you fuck around, put a big bag on your head
'Fore the weather break you're dead
Let's get to it, they don't do it like we do it (Nah)
Cop it, whip it (
Oh, oh
), bag it, 
flip it
Re-up, we up, G'd up, whaddup? (
Yeah
)
Runnin' 'round this bitch, still not givin' a fuck (Ayy)
When it come to that paper there'll be no complications (Haha, that's right)
Put a hole in a nigga right in front of you, your heartbeat pacin'
And it's alright
, that's how we do it on this side
Niggas get to it on this side (
Yeah, yeah
)

It's all a part of the game, you gotta play your cards right
Don't get caught without the pipe all night, lurkin' on sight
Never go without a fight, win or lose, or wrong or right
Protect your life 'cause I'll Deebo it like you was just a bike
Two Cuban links just like I'm Tity Boi,
 ridin' 'round your city, boy
Two-tone boogers up in my face look like a Chip Ahoy
More money, more problems, got me feelin' like I'm Diddy, boy
 (
Yeah, yeah
)
Biggie, boy, now you see why these hoes get jiggy for me (
Oh, oh
)
Try to post up on his block, I bet we won't allow 'em
Might grab that nigga off the lot, we pull 'em in the alley (
Yeah, yeah
)
We need some silence, suppress 'em when he start rattlin' (
Yeah, yeah
)
As you drivin', there'll be hell when you done did a robbery (
Yeah, yeah
)
Not your hoe man, I'm the boss man
Not the dope man but I bring the propane
He had a scope on it but he hit 'em close range
Stormy days but you know we bringin' more rains

I know heartbreaks, setbacks (
Hey

Bitch, if I crap out, I'm sure I'ma 
get back
I been through the 
ups and downs, you know I get around
 (
Yeah
)
So to me, it's all a part of the game (
Brrt, brrt
)
If I ain't the coke man, or the dope man (
Hey

I'm almost for sure man, I gotta take it
No need to say shit, I'm gon' take it
