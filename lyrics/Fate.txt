Title: Fate
Artist: John Legend
[Verse 1: John Legend]
Funny you enter, warm as the day
Sun right through the window until it's gone
Gone, oh
With you in the picture, all up in my eardrum
Drunk on your whisper, what have you done to me?
Let me learn all the truth that you hide skin-deep
Touch it once, now you want alone time with me
And where’s that high even come from?
Pullin' me closer into your culture, it's destiny
Yeah
[Chorus: John Legend & 
Amber Mark
]
Ain’t no shortcuts where we come from
We make diamonds from a breadcrumb
We know every single turn we take
In this bed we've made
It was in our fate
In this watercolor ocean (Watercolor ocean)
We surrender to the motion (Surrender to the motion)
We know every single turn we take
In this bed we've made
It was in our fate, oh
(
Our fate, our fate, our fate, our fate, ooh
)
[Verse 2: Amber Mark]
Man say he feelin' on the future
Lay hands and then he hallelujah
It's supernatural
Ain't this that shit you been askin' for?
We syncopated and
As the world keeps changin'
You and me, we don’t miss a beat

[Pre-Chorus: Amber Mark, 
John Legend
, 
Both
]
Let me learn all the truth that you hide skin-deep
(
Oh, learn all the truth that you hide skin-deep
)
Touch me once, now you want alone time with me
And where’s that high even come from?
Pullin' me closer into your culture, it’s history
 (History, history)
[Chorus: John Legend, 
John Legend & Amber Mark
]
Ain't no shortcuts where we come from
We make diamonds from a breadcrumb
We know every single turn 
we take
In this bed 
we've made
It was in 
our fate
In this watercolor ocean (
In this watercolor ocean
)
We surrender to the motion (
We surrender to the motion
)
We know every single turn 
we take
In this bed 
we've made
It was in 
our fate
[Outro: John Legend, 
Amber Mark
, 
Both
]
Woah
, 
our fate
 (Yeah)
Ain’t no shortcuts where we come from
We make diamonds from a breadcrumb
We know every single turn we take
In this bed we've made
It was in our fate, yeah
