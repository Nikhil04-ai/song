[Intro: Big Gipp sample]
"Uh, y'all know what it is..."
"Uh, y'all know what it is..."
"Uh, y'all know what it is..."
[Verse 1: T-Mo Goodie]
Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken (Spoken)
Words of a change I don't feel but I see
Visions from me, at 23
Making it free in my community one day is what I live for
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots, I kick in 'til I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put it down with the frown
What goes 'round comes 'round, from
 
MLK to Cascade
I know it's through them penny figures
Cocaine dealers throw the walk signs up in they rides
Looking cleaner than I seen 'em the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter ki's
Stacking G's
, in the South Indies
My nigga, them folks riding bicycles
Hummer vehicles off in the hood
Knowin' each and every nigga selling – but can you blame?
Seems like the only way a brother can survive the game
To fly, hard to get by
The dope dealing, fatal killings, and Fed time, to writing rhymes
It ain't just the police, we kill each other
Just lost another brother
Fast living'll get you took
Thinking it can't happen to you, and then it do
Off crooked schemes, it's just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream (The mainstream)

[Hook: Khujo Goodie]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
[Verse 2: André 3000]
They swan diving
As if they name be Gretchen von Ivan
Volkoff, rushin' to finish their album, then you find them
Lost, dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?
He rhymed the "catch of the day," when the recipe called for "blackened"
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish of them greens
And it's enticing, how them Jones's sing
"So I'm gonna sang just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch they rim, if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down, and then swallow"
I hope you vomit, won't call no names, 'cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are
But if you don't – you never will, you'll just proceed to steal
But then it might get ugly 'cause, trust me, niggas do feel–
The way that I felt when I wrote this
But we must stay in focus
Be kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Face down, face down, face down

[Hook: Khujo Goodie]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
[Verse 3: Khujo Goodie]
I let you stay in my crib
Now you know where I live
When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal
Look at the hand you deal'
Me crudball business, niggas giving inches, so here, take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horse shoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher
Until we get our own plate, I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours
Process sm-m-moking like Jerry
Meanwhile, fairies up the street, sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to attain another level of con-sci-ence, only to test the potency
Wild land here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed
They's thieves, with decisions to make, networks shape your destiny
But one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say
"I wish I never did what I did," now face this bid
It was the company you kept, the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin
 
and your nigga' bitch in the club showin' pink for 10
They got you niggas where they want you again
Floating face down in the mainstream
That's why, that's why, that's why

[Hook: Khujo Goodie]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Everybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their heads
Thinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about your self
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family,
 
up and down like hoes give head
To dicks, oh, six, seven of them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique, bitch
Oh, what? You don't want me to call you slut?
But why you fucking all them niggas, letting them all up in your guts?
But see, that AIDS, I'm afraid, I think that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking'a lettin' that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream, home team bangin' 'em with these hits
In the mix (Mix), flowing like some motherfuckin' swordfish
[Hook: Khujo Goodie]
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
