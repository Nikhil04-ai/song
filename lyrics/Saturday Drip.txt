[Intro: Mark]
Yeah, what's the date today? (I told you)
Ooh
[Chorus: Mark, 
Jeno
]
Saturday drip (
Drip
)
하나 둘씩 쓰러져 픽-픽
Saturday drip (
Wow
)
Me and my clique
찍었어 peak, peak (Woo)
[Verse 1: Jaemin, 
Jeno
, 
Mark
]
소리치지 "Veni, vidi, vici" like Caeser's back
자신감이 넘치지 (
Yeah
)
Is it real? 놀란 표정들이
이건 꿈 아니지만, we're another one
여기저기 터지는 불빛들
 (
Yeah
)
셔츠 위에 cuffs link, 전부 couture
 (
Woo
)
우린 멋지게 살 거야
 (
Uh-huh
)
One life to live. 너도 원한다면, just come with me
 (
Yeah
)
[Pre-Chorus: Jisung, 
Jeno
, 
Mark
]
Monday to Friday
우린 해냈어 (
Yeah, we did it, uh
)
오늘 이 밤은 (
Yeah
), now we have to toast (
Now we have to
)
Workin' and playin' so hard
그게 motto 보여줘 너만의 vibe, like pop, pop
이제야 말이 통해 I love it, 흘러넘치네 멋이

[Chorus: Jaemin]
Saturday drip (Drip)
하나 둘씩 쓰러져 픽픽
Saturday drip (Wow)
Me and my clique
찍었어 peak, peak
[Post-Chorus: Mark, 
Jisung
]
We like drip, drop, drip, drip, drop
비가 쏟아진 것 같지
We likе drip, drop, drip, drip, drop
 (Yeah)
넘쳐흘러 지금 멋이, hold up
(Hold up, hold up, hol-hol-ho-ho)
[Verse 2: Mark, 
Jeno
, 
Jisung
]
This, that 1960's처럼, classic해 쓸어넘긴 slick back
Breath in 숨을 깊게, 들이마신 뒤에, 너에게로 click, clack
알아 넌 gourmet, but my lifе is more than
Five stars 나를 따라 맛을 볼래
알아 넌 artist 섞어 너의 water and color
Drip, drip, drip like Jackson Pollock
[Pre-Chorus: Jaemin, 
Jisung
, 
Jeno
, 
Mark
]
너무 빨리 달려왔어, 우린 이쯤에서 time off
Pull up on it on this Saturday
 (
Saturday
)
날카롭던 감각을 lay back
Workin' and playin' so hard, 그게 motto
보여줘 너만의 vibe, like pop, pop
이제야 말이 통해 I love it, 흘러넘치네 멋이

[Chorus: Jisung, 
All
]
Saturday drip (
Drip it
)
하나둘씩 쓰러져 픽-픽 (
Hey, hey
)
Saturday drip (
Drip it
)
Me and my clique
찍었어 peak, peak (
Hey, hey
)
[Post-Chorus: Jaemin, 
All
, 
Jeno
]
We like drip, drop, drip, drip, drop (
Ayy
)
비가 쏟아진 것 같지 (
같지
)
We like drip, drop, drip, drip, drop
 (
Ayy
)
넘쳐흘러 지금 멋이, hold up
[Bridge: All, 
Mark
, 
Jeno
]
Ayy, this how it goes
Saturday drip, touching the floor (
Yeah, yeah
)
Ayy, give me some more (
Hoo!
)
Don't need to trip, stack it and blow
Drip too hard, everybody get back, get back
파도쳐 물에 잠기겠어, 위험해, 위험해
해가 뜰 때쯤엔 you can see the golden horizon
자신 있다면 우리와 divin'
 (Sheesh)
(
What you doin' on the weekend?
)
[Chorus: Jeno, 
All
]
Saturday drip (
