Title: Not Me
Artist: Elton John
[RADAMES]
[MEREB]
I once knew all the answers
I stood on certain ground
A picture of true happiness
A confidence so effortless
No brighter could be found
Oh no
I never asked the questions
That trouble me today
I knew all  was to know
Love worn lightly, put on show
My conquests on display
I can't believe he's changing
And who'd have thought that confidence could die?
Oh no
Not me, not me
Not me, not me
That all I took for granted was a lie
Oh no
Not me, not me
  Not me,no not me
And who'd have guessed I'd throw my world away
To be with someone I'm afraid will say
Not me, not me
This can never be
[MEREB]
He's in love
But he's not the only one
Who'll be changed
[AMNERIS, spoken]
Why hasn't Radames come to see me again? We're to be married in three days, and yet... Aida, I must make things right with him!
[AIDA]
I shall not envy lovers
But long for what they share
[AMNERIS]
An empty room is merciless
Don't be surprised if I confess
I need some comfort
[AIDA, AMNERIS]
And who'd have thought a love could be so good?
Not me, not me
And show me things I never understood
Not me, not me
And who'd have guessed he'd throw his world away
To be with someone 'til his dying day?
Not me, not me
[RADAMES]
[AMNERIS/AIDA]
[MEREB]
And who'd have
Thought a love
Could be so good? 
And who'd have
Thought a love
Could be so good? 
No good
Not me
Not me
Not me
Not me
Not me
Not me
My secrets and
My passions
Understood
His secrets and
His passions
Understood
No good
Not me
Not me
Not me
Not me
Not me
Not me
And who'd have
Guessed I'd throw
My world away
To be with someone
'til my dying day?
And who'd have
Guessed he'd throw
His world away
To be with someone
'til his dying day?
Not me
Not me
Not me
Not me
This can
Never be
Radames
Not me
Oh, not me
