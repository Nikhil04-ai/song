Title: sdp interlude (Original)
Artist: Travis Scott 
Â 
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
You taste good like soul food
Parked up outside in the old-school
The new me back with the old you
A dog always find his way back home and it's so true
Make it home, fall through and pop one
You know the motto's: "Smoke some, drink some, pop one"
Got your hand on my Glock while your ass ride shotgun
High, high stakes, we risk it every day
Ride around, around
I know fuckin' ugly niggas just not fun
Had to zero out the fade 'cause I'm not one, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
So smoke some, drink some, pop one (Lit)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one (Lit)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one (Lit)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one (Lit)
Yeah
[Chorus: Cassie & Travis Scott, 
Travis Scott
]
Smoke some, drink some, pop one
Smoke some, drink some, pop one 
(Ooh-ah)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one
Smoke some, drink some, pop one 
(Ooh-ah)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one
Smoke some, drink some, pop one (
Yeah-yeah, yeah
)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one
Smoke some, drink some, pop one 
(Yeah)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one
Smoke some, drink some, pop one 
(Ooh-ah)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one
Smoke some, drink some, pop one
Smoke some, drink some, pop one
Smoke some, drink some, pop one
Smoke some, drink some, pop one
Smoke some, drink some, pop one

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright)
I'ma run through
On the front stoops all gettin' ran through, yeah
Right, ball with it
Yeah, I'm in a cat call with it
Yeah, I made phone calls with it
Yeah, I made bank calls with it, yeah
And H-Town lately where you find me, yeah
Ride 'round city, no ID, yeah
Back of the Benz where I find peace, yeah
Beats popular
And me notchin' this
From 
doo-wop
