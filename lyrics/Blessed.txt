Title: Blessed
Artist: Elton John
[Verse 1]
Hey you, you're a child in my head
You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed
[Verse 2]
I know you're still just a dream
Your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway you'll be blessed
[Chorus]
And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed
[Verse 3]
I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed

[Chorus]
And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that
You, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed
[Instrumental Break]
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed
You'll be blessed
