[Intro: Germ]
Bitch, I been that motherfucker, always loaded
Hoping that these faggots fucking die
Middle finger—
That motherfucker, always loaded
Hoping that these faggots fucking die
Bitch, I been that motherfucker, always loaded
Hoping that these faggots fucking die
Middle finger—
That motherfucker, always loaded
Hoping that—
Bitch, I been that—
[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
Crashin' dirty Rari, poppin' percs at parties
Swervin' Kawasaki, 30 flip a body
Keep me feeling muddy, perkys in my tummy
I don't need no bitch, I leave my dick running
40 clip jerk out the 30
Smashing the gas, it gon' skrrtie
VVS bleeding, they on me
Shorty keep sucking all on me
AK verging, blast, swish a pint at last
Smoke a pound of gas, Panamera smash
Diamond keep dancing real clean
Ex bitch, she ain't over me

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
40 on me, I pop it
Ate a tec, I'ma drop it
Audi Coupe, yeah I swerve it
My diamonds they dancing so perfect
40 on me, I pop it
Ate a tec, I'ma drop it
Audi Coupe, yeah I swerve it
My diamonds they dancing so perfect
[Verse 2: Pouya]
I don't relate to nobody
The violence, the sirens, they get you excited
Never let 'em see the other side
Of me and my mind, it get deeper with time
If you jump out the line, you get back in that hoe
Underground Underdog, pull out a hundred racks
Just to flex at my old high school running back
Get in line bitch, everybody hate
Rappers wanna run around and talk on me daily
Saying no names, yeah they talking real vaguely
Lately my mood has been bitch you can't phase me
[Chorus: Fat Nick]
40 on me, I pop it
Ate a tec, I'ma drop it
Audi Coupe, yeah I swerve it
My diamonds they dancing so perfect
40 on me, I pop it
Ate a tec, I'ma drop it
Audi Coupe, yeah I swerve it
My diamonds they dancing so perfect
