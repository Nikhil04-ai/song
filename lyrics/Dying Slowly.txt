Title: Dying Slowly
Artist: Crush
[Chorus]
OG, everybody know me
Count money with my homies, don't need nobody to float me
Sippin' on the OE, I know I'm dying slowly
So I just copped a Rollie to slit my wrist and OD, to slit my— my—
OG, everybody know me
Count money with my homies, don't need nobody to float me
Sippin' on the OE, I know I'm dying slowly
So I just copped a Rollie to slit my wrist and OD, O— OD— O— O—
[Verse 1]
Ten years in the game, I seen rappers come and go
A couple of murders, overdoses, suicide don't seem to slow
Sleepin' on the couch, it's roaches crawlin' all around me
Got a bounty on my head, you know where to find me
Take me back in time, I got some things I gotta say to the ones no longer in my life
One more conversation, help me sleep at night
I'm stuck with deathbed text messages, visions that burn through my skull
Wishin' I could see you one more time before my time to go
[Chorus]
OG, everybody know me
Count money with my homies, don't need nobody to float me
Sippin' on the OE, I know I'm dying slowly
So I just copped a Rollie to slit my wrist and OD, O— OD— O—

[Verse 2]
I set the bar so high, I'll die before I reach my prime
But if my words could live forever, then it's worth my time
This bread get me out my bed, but not to Utopia
These meds give me a level head instead of seeing red
I plead, I beg, I see what you bitches said about me
I don't gotta take advantage of nobody
Bitch, I'm a legend in my city, got 'em shakin' when they see me
I'm on dubs in that 'Lac, I show love and they show back, yeah
[Chorus]
OG, everybody know me
Count money with my homies, don't need nobody to float me
Sippin' on the OE, I know I'm dying slowly
So I just copped a Rollie to slit my wrist and OD, O— OD— O—
[Outro]
OG, everybody know me
Count money with my homies, don't need nobody to float me
Sippin' on the OE, I know I'm dying slowly
So I just copped a Rollie to slit my wrist and OD
