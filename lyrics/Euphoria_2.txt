Title: Euphoria
Artist: Muse
Â 
[Verse 1]
Shut down, we are growing spiritless
If no one cares, then who is gonna save us?
And give us euphoria
Worn out, everything will fall apart
So shine a light and warm up this heavy heart
And give us euphoria
[Pre-Chorus]
Brooding
I need renewing
I want satisfaction
A gut reaction
[Chorus]
And give us euphoria, and give us euphoria
It's been all work and no play
Give us euphoria, and give us euphoria
I need to numb all the pain
[Verse 2]
Wake up, we're becoming restless
Our last hope and only you can save us
And give us euphoria
Sealed off, we are running out of air
So start a fire and spice up this love affair
And give us euphoria

[Pre-Chorus]
Brooding
I need renewing
I need satisfaction
A gut reaction
[Chorus]
And give us euphoria, give us euphoria
It's been all work and no play
Give us euphoria, and give us euphoria
I need to numb all the pain
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Euphoria, and give us euphoria
It's been all work and no play
Give me euphoria, I need euphoria
I need to numb all the pain
