Artist: Lady Gaga
 
[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
Go get your friends and meet 
me on the floor
You're out of candy, I can get you mo-o-ore
You started slurrin', and I start to squeal
I'm fallin' over in my nine-inch heels
[Pre-Chorus]
Come on
(So hit the lights) Come on and hit me, come on
(DJ, hit the lights) DJ, come on
(So hit the lights) Come on and hit me, come on
(DJ, hit the lights)
[Chorus]
I could be your girlfriend for the weekend
You could be my boyfriend for the night
My excuse to make a bad decision
Bodies gettin' close under the lights
(Oh) I've been feelin' this familiar feeling
Like I've known you my wholе life
(Oh) Take you to the Gardеn of Eden
Poison apple, take a bite (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Oh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden
[Verse 2]
You're turnin' green from the adrenaline
This chick's a machine, but her friend is way more fun
But you can't hear her with the music on
So you say "yes" and then the party's o-on
[Pre-Chorus]
Come on
(So hit the lights) Come on and hit me, come on
(DJ, hit the lights)
[Chorus]
I could be your girlfriend for the weekend
You could be my boyfriend for the night
My excuse to make a bad decision
Bodies getting close under the lights
(Oh) I've been feelin' this familiar feeling
Like I've known you my whole life
(Oh) Take you to the Garden of Eden
Poison apple, take a bite (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Oh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Come on)
[Bridge]
(So hit the lights) Come on and hit me, come on
(DJ, hit the lights) Oh (Come on)
(So hit the lights) Come on and hit me, come on
(DJ, hit the lights) Oh
[Chorus]
I could be your girlfriend for the weekend
You could be my boyfriend for the night
My excuse to make a bad decision
Bodies getting close under the lights
(Oh) I've been feelin' this familiar feeling
Like I've known you my whole life (
Whole life
)
(Oh) Take you to the Garden of Eden
Poison apple, take a bite (
Take a bite
) (Oh)
[Post-Chorus]
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Oh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden

[Outro]
Uh, uh
Ooh
Oh
Yeah
