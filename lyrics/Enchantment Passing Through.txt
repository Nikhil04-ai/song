Title: Enchantment Passing Through
Artist: Elton John
[RADAMES]
To sail away to half discovered places
To see the secrets so few eyes have seen
To see moments of enchantment on our faces
The moments when we smile and those in between
[AIDA]
If I could leave this place then I'd be sailing
To corners of my land where there would be
Sweet southern winds of liberty prevailing
The beauty so majestic and so free
[RADAMES, spoken]
I will take you sailing, South.  You can be my guide
(sung)
There'd be no ties of time and space to bind me
[AIDA]
And no horizon I could not pursue
[RADAMES]
I'd leave the world's misfortunes far behind me
[AIDA]
I'd put my faith and trusting in something new

[BOTH]
But why should I tell you this
[AIDA]
A stranger I just met
[RADAMES]
A woman whom I hardly know at all and should forget
[BOTH]
A journey we can only dream of
Enchantment passing through
And how is it I say these things
So easily to you
[RADAMES, spoken]
I'll never take you sailing!  
I might never  leave Egypt again!
[AIDA, spoken]
You talk as though you've been enslaved!  If you don't like your fate, change it!  You are your own master, there are no shackles on you!  So don't expect any pity or understanding from this humble palace slave!
[RADAMES]
And why did I tell her this?
A stranger I've just met
A woman who I hardly know at all 
and will forget
Anonymous and gone tomorrow
Enchantment passing through
And all I've done is tell her things
She already knew
She knew ...She knew....
