Title: Miss This*
Artist: Olivia Rodrigo
Lyrics from Snippet:
[Verse]
Right now I'm sitting in my room writing a song
It’s never felt like home here but I guess it's not far off
Mom is in the kitchen and my clothes are on the floor
Homesick disposition, with one foot out the door
And I live in the suburbs, but it's a quick drive into town
I pretend it’s New York City when no one else is around
And there's parents and their kids there in the lawn
I forgot that in a year it'll be gone
[Chorus]
I miss this, but I'm living it
Wish I could grab life by the shoulders
And scream, "I'm sick of getting older"
'Cause I miss this, but I'm living it
One day I'll move on, one day I’ll move out
And I’ll wish that I was where I am right now
