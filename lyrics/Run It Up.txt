Title: Run It Up
Artist: Crush
[Chorus: Fat Nick]
Syrup inside of me hittin'
Prada my step when I'm tippin'
Knots in my pockets I'm limpin'
See, 
at the trap door
, man my profit is flippin'
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
Syrup inside of me hittin'
Prada my step when I'm tippin'
Knots in my pockets I'm limpin'
See, 
at the trap door
, man my profit is flippin'
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
[Verse 1: Pouya]
Looking at me like I'm some crazy wack ass rapper
You can't even keep up
9-11 with the heats up
Broke boy better ease up
Come through, I'll show you how to get your cheese up
Now I got my feats up, Now I got my feet up
No lie, ran through your 5, toe tagging any rapper that feed my fire
Crumby ass hoe, you a piece of the pie
Only fuck with the whole thing
No half-ass hoes under my wing
Just real-ass women that hold me down
Maybe back in the day, but you canâ€™t fool me now
Underground Underdog, run it up, flip it up, pile it up (Bitch)

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
Syrup inside of me hittin'
Prada my step when I'm tippin'
Knots in my pockets I'm limpin'
See, 
at the trap door
, man my profit is flippin'
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
Syrup inside of me hittin'
Prada my step when I'm tippin'
Knots in my pockets I'm limpin'
See, 
at the trap door
, man my profit is flippin'
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
[Verse 2: Fat Nick]
I just popped some pills, these Vicodins we fucked it up
223 extended aiming out the Hummer trucks
If he acting up gon' grab a dick and let it bust
I ain't ever need a bitch, come over, catch a nut
Lexus skrrt, got a 40 on me
Fendi top, we dropping bodies
Percs and molly, eyes glossy
Diamonds dancing, that be the hobby
I just wanna smoke on this boof
Flexing throw cash out the roof
Rick Owens I step, be the truth

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
Syrup inside of me hittin'
Prada my step when I'm tippin'
Knots in my pockets I'm limpin'
See, 
at the trap door
, man my profit is flippin'
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
Syrup inside of me hittin'
Prada my step when I'm tippin'
Knots in my pockets I'm limpin'
See, 
at the trap door
, man my profit is flippin'
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up, flip it up
