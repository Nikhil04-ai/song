Artist: Serena
[Verse 1]
I count one Mississippi
And I'm out of town
Feel my vibe
Feel it tonight
Two Mississippi
In the second round
I just wanna feel this alright
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna let go no more
I don't wanna go home no more
Till wicked sound is low
And we dance into the daylight
[Chorus]
I'm rich
If you re mine
I don't need a
Dollar, dollar bill
I can feel the love you got...
Gasolina!
Burn it up
Gasolina!
[Post-Chorus]
The rich are getting richer everyday
Well, well
The poor men are suffering everywhere
The rich are getting richer everyday
Well, well, too much a wickedness I pray
The rich are getting richer everyday
Well, well
The poor men are suffering everywhere
The rich are getting richer everyday
Well, well, too much a wickedness I pray

[Chorus]
I'm rich
If you're mine
I don't need a
Dollar, dollar bill
I can feel the love you got...
Gasolina!
Burn it up
Gasolina!
[Verse 2]
I count two Mississippi
Put my high heels on
Be in my vibe
Feel it tonight
Don't need cash
'Cause I got you now
It's Saturday
And the night is young
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna let go no more
I don't wanna go home no more
Till wicked sound is low
And it fades into the daylight

[Chorus]
I'm rich
If you're mine
I don't need a
Dollar, dollar bill
I can feel the love you got...
Gasolina!
Burn it up
Gasolina!
[Post-Chorus]
The rich are getting richer everyday
Well, well
The poor men are suffering everywhere
The rich are getting richer everyday
Well, well, too much a wickedness I pray
The rich are getting richer everyday
Well, well
The poor men are suffering everywhere
The rich are getting richer everyday
Well, well, too much a wickedness I pray
[Chorus]
I'm rich
If you're mine
I don't need a
Dollar, dollar bill
I can feel the…
I'm rich
If you're mine
I don't need a
Dollar, dollar bill
I can feel the…

[Post-Chorus]
The rich are getting richer everyday
Well, well
The poor men are suffering everywhere
The rich are getting richer everyday
Well, well, too much a wickedness I pray
[Outro]
It's not about the money anyway-away
You make it feel it everyday
It's not about the struggle, away
I'm gonna make them sunny days
