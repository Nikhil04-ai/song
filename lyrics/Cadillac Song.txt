Title: Cadillac Song
Artist: Ariana Grande
Â 
[Chorus]
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had
And, baby, that won't change
[Post-Chorus]
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you
[Verse 1]
Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
'Cause sometimes I catch myself
[Chorus]
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had
And baby, that won't change

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you
You, yeah
Ooh
[Verse 2]
Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
'Cause sometimes I catch myself
[Chorus]
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had
And, baby, that won't change
[Post-Chorus]
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you
You, yeah

[Outro]
Mm (Oh)
Mm
Oh, baby
Oh, babe
