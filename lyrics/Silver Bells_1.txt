Title: Silver Bells
Artist: Stievie Wonder
[Verse 1]
City sidewalks
Busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
[Chorus]
Silver bells (silver bells), silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling), hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
[Verse 2]
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you hear

[Chorus]
Silver bells (silver bells), silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling), hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
[Chorus]
Silver bells (silver bells), I hear silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling), hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Silver bells (silver bells), I hear silver bells (silver bells)...
