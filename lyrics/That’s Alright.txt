Title: Thatâ€™s Alright
Artist: Etta James
[Verse 1]
You told me, baby, once upon a time
If I'd be yours, little boy, you'd be mine
[Chorus]
But that's alright
I know you love another girl but that's alright
Well, sometimes I wonder who's lovin' you tonight
[Verse 2]
You told me, baby, your love for me was strong
When I woke up this morning, all your big words had gone
[Chorus]
But that's alright
I know you love another girl but that's alright
Sometimes I wonder who's lovin' you tonight
[Verse 3]
When I was lovin' you, you just couldn't understand
You gone and left me here without a man
[Chorus]
But that's alright
I know you love another girl but that's alright
Sometimes I wonder who's lovin' you tonight

[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
You told me, baby, once upon a time
If I'd be yours, little boy, you'd be mine
[Chorus]
But that's alright
I know you love another girl but that's alright
Sometimes I wonder who's lovin' you tonight
[Outro]
Oh yeah
