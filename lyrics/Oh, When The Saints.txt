Title: Oh, When The Saints
Artist: Lady Gaga
[Chorus]
Oh, when the saints go marchin' in
Oh, when the saints go marchin' in
Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marchin' in
[Verse 1]
Oh, on that day they called my name
I took a breath and then I prayed
Oh, how I want to sing with the angels
When the saints do their parade
[Verse 2]
I talk to God about my heart
The devil plays some mean guitar
Oh, I would love to dance up in Heaven
When the saints go play their part
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
The sky went dark, I fell apart
Fell to my knees, I cried so hard
And then I said goodbye to my children
Hoping they'd carry me far

[Chorus]
Oh, whеn the saints go marchin' in
Oh, when the saints go marchin' in
Lord, I want to bе in that number
When the saints go marchin' in
