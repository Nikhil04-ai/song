Title: Thatâ€™s How Much I Love You
Artist: Frank Sinatra
If I had a nickel, I know what I would do
I'd spend it all for candy and I'd give it all to you
I'd spend it all for candy and give it all to you
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, baby
If you were a picture, I'd hang you up on the wall
Sit back where I could see you and I'd never move at all
Sit back where I could see you, never move at all
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, baby
If you were a kitten, with pretty glossy fur
I'd take you up and stroke you, listen to you purr
I'd take you up and stroke you, listen to you purr
Mmmm, that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, dear
And if you were a tiger, I'd hang around your den
And pester you, my honey, until you let me in
And pester you, my honey, till you let me in
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, baby
Baby, if you were horse fly and I an old gray mare
I'd stand and let you bite me, and I'd never move a hair
I'd stand and let you bite me, never move a hair
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, baby
If you want to marry, now let me tell you what
We'll go and find a parson, and I'd let him tie the knot
We'll go and find a parson, and let him tie the knot
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, dear

When I say you I love you, honey child, I leans on you a little bit
