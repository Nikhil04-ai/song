Title: Silver Sable
Artist: Cigarettes After Sex
[Verse 1]
Silver Sable style
Back in a Marvel Swimsuit Special from the early '90s
Page eleven, the second edition
With that look on her face
[Pre-Chorus]
Right now it's only the light from the closet
And the radio's just playing soft hits
Need that atmosphere, I need that sweet life
With its decadent ways
[Chorus]
Stay with me now, I don't wanna be lonely
Know how you feel by the way that you hold me
And when we kiss we don't need to close our
Eyes in the dark at all
[Verse 2]
Silver Sable style, the way you watch me
Sipping from your straw in 34D
Whispering the words, "vanilla creme pie"
To see the look on my face
[Pre-Chorus]
And still it's only the light from the closet
And "
Number of the Beast
" is on your Walkman
And page eleven's gone, see that it's ripped out
And hanging up on your wall

[Chorus]
Stay with me now, I don't wanna be lonely
Know how you feel by the way that you hold me
And when we kiss we don't need to close our
Eyes in the dark at all
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
Stay with me now, I don't wanna be lonely
Know how you feel by the way that you hold me
And when we kiss we don't need to close our
Eyes in the dark at all
[Outro]
Eyes in the dark at all
Eyes in the dark at all
Eyes in the dark at all
