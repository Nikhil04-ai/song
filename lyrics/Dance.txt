[Intro]
One more time, one more time
Uh, one more time
Uh, one more time
[Verse 1]
I dream of the day I can go back to when I was born
Layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, Mom
Wish you'd appear, just for a second from Heaven
My tears would be gone, I wouldn't be rappin' this song
I'd be happy drivin' up to your eight-bedroom mansion
Up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchanting
Beyond Galileo's understanding
Past the Milky Way and all the planets
There's somethin' out there greater, but only God knows
Scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though
That was part of our conversation
I spark one up and start blazin'
Thinkin' of how amazing she was, an angel gave me love
I'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
I pray, when I marry, my wife'll have one of your skills
But, Mom, you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up just to see you one more day, to have—
[Chorus]
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

[Verse 2]
I wish you were here, I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace, forever, I accepted you're free
A blessing to me – I see you dressed in all white
Smilin' at me, happy, knowin' everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter, just one more time
My chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th, '02 –
That's when the gates of Heaven opened up, for you to stroll through
Beautiful Anne Jones – job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on, and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, Mommy, dance with him!
And you've been my guide, through all the trouble I faced
They playin' our song, the life-beat, my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand, I'm tryin' not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed, dreaming I can have—
[Chorus]
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma
Praying, wishing that I could have
One more dance with you, Momma
If I could only have
One more dance with you, Momma

[Outro]
I love you forever, Mom
You will always live through me, always
Uh, uh, uh, yeah
