Artist: Queen
 
[Verse 1]
I'm not invited to the party
Been sitting here all night
I'm all alone at the party
I don't feel all right
Ain't got no black coat
Ain't got no tie
I gotta shape up now
Come on, baby, you gotta know why
Ha, take off!
[Chorus]
Dancer, dancer
I can't live with it, I'm gonna die without it
Dancer
 (Huh), 
dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me?
[Post-Chorus]
Cool
[Verse 2]
You're the life and soul of the funk-tion
It took me all night
To get hold of the right introduction
Blew me out of sight
I taste your lipstick 
(Yeah)
I look in your eyes 
(What?)
You feel fantastic 
(Yes)
My body cries 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's what I said (Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da)

[Chorus]
Dancer
 (Yeah), 
dancer
I can't live with it, I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me?
Ah (Ah)
Hot space, let's go
[Guitar Solo]
Oh, yeah!
Wooh!
Haha, yeah, yeah!
Huh-hu, hu-uh-uh, hu-uh-uh
Take it
Yeah, my feet are begging, hu!
[Chorus]
Dancer
 (Ha!), 
dancer
Oh, I can't believe you're dancing
Dancer
 (Ha!), 
dancer
Can't take you home, I can't take you dancing
Dancer, dancer
 (Hey)
Just bring out the funk and dance the night away
Dancer
 (Yeah), 
dancer
You gotta boogie

[Guitar Solo]
Ooh! Sure
Gotta shout about it
Yeah, please me
[Chorus]
Dancer, dancer
 (Wooh)
Oh, don't fight temptation
Dancer, dancer
 (Oh, yeah, ah)
Dancer, dancer
Aw, baby, dance, dance, dance, dance, dan—
[Outro]
Guten Morgen, Sie wünschten, geweckt zu werden
Dancer, dancer
Dancer, dancer
Dancer, dancer
Come on, sugar!
Shake on out!
