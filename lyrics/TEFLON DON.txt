[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Beat the first case like John Gotti, woah
Beat the first case like
[Chorus]
Beat the first case like John Gotti
Anything you want, my dogs got
Bitch, I'm a boss, I call shot
Spread a few bands at the raw spot (Boy, you been)
[Verse]
Got the rock poppin' at the hotel
Ready, run a play for a whole bail (How you get—)
'Fore it hit the plate, make the house smell
Throwin' up trays and Margiela
Once I'm in the chain, need an Advil (Freebandz, nigga)
Motion on motion, that's how I feel
Came from the field, I'ma crash first (Fuck all the opps)
Makе your mama cry, gotta hit her where it hurts (Grrt, grrt)
Thеy come from my side, they gon' shoot up the church
From nine to five, got nine goin' bezerk (Ayy, say gang)
I'm goin' on a mission, I'm stayin' alert
I'm the man on the streets, chop the top off the vert (Plutoski)
Bitch, you feelin' me? Bitch, I'm feelin' me too, got the energy
Turn a ho on a stroll out in Tennessee
I control all the motion, it been beneath
Really crunk up the shit, talkin' V-nee-nee
All my bitches be turnt, that Cha-nee-nee
I got stripes on the turf, ain't no kiddin' me
Got my ice on the dirt, is you shittin' me?
Got the load on the boat, dropped the pin in it
Hit the nitro, the motor, I'm pushin' it (Freebandz)
I don't want a recorder, two hundred me
I'm on top of this shit, killers under me
Might just fuck up the money on a tragedy
You put bread on a dummy for threatenin' me (Murk)
Put that tape on a drummy and press delete
He was drivin', his brain was sittin' on the seat
I fly dope out the country to TrestleTree (Woo)
I been flyer than a pilot, I got the key
Fuck it, put them narcotics back on the street
Run the block, we gon' snatch you a Cuban link (Ski)
Tote two Dracos on me 'cause the trench in me (Ski)
Hear my chains when they clank 'cause I'm turnin' up (Freebandz)
See the money you get, I be burnin' up
That's a forty on the fit, I put on the stuff (Slatt)
I went out and went got it when time was tough (Slatt)
I whooped up a Bugatti, this one for Chuck
Free my brothers forever, it's only us
Ain't no love for the others, we set 'em up
Grrt, grrt, ski

[Pre-Chorus]
Plutoski, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Beat the first case like John Gotti, woah
Beat the first case like
[Chorus]
Beat the first case like John Gotti
Anything you want, my dogs got
Bitch, I'm a boss, I call shot
Spread a few bands at the raw spot (
