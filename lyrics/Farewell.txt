Title: Farewell
Artist: Eminem
 
[Intro]
Ricky Racks
For what it's worth, you were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick, you'd fuck the Earth
I tried to get over you, it doesn't work
You're still a cunt, I'm still a fucking jerk
[Verse 1]
Same as it ever was, yeah
Say it'll change, but it never does, ain't gonna ever 'cause
You're the cause of my pain and the medicine
Never met someone who played games with my head as much
Fate tethered us together like two felons
Must've fell in love with skeletons
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but (Yeah)
Feels like I slept with the (Uh), wicked stepmother
But how the hell am I still in love
With a motherfucking chick there's at least a million of?
They say love the one you with, but this shit is killing us
Our love's on some other shit
I'm a glutton for punishment
You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts
It's above and beyond us cuffing
I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
If I catch you sucking another dick, you better unsuck it
You snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
Why am I tucking you in? Probably 'cause

[Chorus]
I gotta tell myself
Another lie 'cause that's what helps
To get me by, 'cause I'm in Hell
But this is my goodbye, farewell
[Verse 2]
Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you
Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you
Wanna heal you, yeah
Wanna lose you, keep you, bruise you
Beat, abuse you, treat you mutual
It's juvenile, delusional, as usual
You're beautiful, I'm average (Woo)
I'm brutal, you're a savage
My ride-or-die chick who's always cruising for a bruising
Yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick
Though we might get along like shit
Fight, hit, bite, spit, unite, split
Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine
And they say love is blind, we see each other fine
But it's no wonder I'm (Yeah), the only one you'll find (Uh)
To put up with your shit (What?), I need a plumber line (Yeah)
But nothing comes to mind (Nah), besides the number ninety (No)
'Cause since '06, you flipped my fucking life
Upside down, now the sky's ground
Look at my frown, it's a smile now
Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows
Make it rain upwards, we're on that ninth cloud
Two insane lovebirds, I should fly south
'Cause, man, am I great at lyin' to myself
But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm Audi five thou'
But this is my house, bitch, you get out
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
Then we say fuck it, cry our eyes out, then...

[Chorus]
I gotta tell myself
Another lie 'cause that's what helps
To get me by, 'cause I'm in Hell
But this is my goodbye, farewell
[Verse 3]
This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be
Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts
'Cause that's what attracts us, trick you with a back rub
Tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub (Haha)
Yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic
But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us
I love you but I won't exchange vows
Hey now, don't get carried away
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
Yeah, but we're so insane 'bout each other
May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau
Break out Berettas, lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
Who knows how it's gonna play out?
Or whether death's what our ending will be
One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
But I'll go to bat for you, defending your honor
Yeah, no contingency fees, something we're not, nah
We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
Could've been a fifty-cent ring from out of a vending machine
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
Guess I'm a prisoner, see? Addiction is a disease

[Chorus]
I gotta tell myself
Another lie 'cause that's what helps
To get me by, 'cause I'm in Hell
But this is my goodbye, farewell
[Outro]
Love you, girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah
