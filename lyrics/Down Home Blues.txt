Title: Down Home Blues
Artist: Etta James
[Verse 1]
You say, your party's jumpin', everybody's havin' a good time
And you know what's goin' through my mind
Do you mind if I get comfortable, and kick off these shoes?
While you're fixin' me a drink
Play me some of them down home blues
[Verse 2]
You know, I don't get out much on the town
And you know I done cut out a lot of that runnin' around
All week long, I've been keepin' my cool
But tonight I'm lettin' my hair down
And get down with these down home blues
[Chorus]
Down home blues, down home blues
All I wanna hear is these down home blues
All night long, every other record or two
Now take off those fast jams
And let me hear some down home blues, alright
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
You know my old man is gonna wanna fight
Because of the hour I'll be getting in tonight
I don't care, I am gonna do as I choose
I'm gonna get my head real bad
And party off of these down home blues, hey, hey yeah

[Outro]
Down home blues, down home blues
And all I wanna hear is those down home blues
All night long, every other record or two
I say, I'm gonna get my head real bad
Party off of these down home, home blues
Yeah, yeah, yeah, down home blues
