Title: Erase/Replace
Artist: Foo Fighters
Â 
[Verse 1]
Attention, pay attention
No mention, a sickest array
A mission, an admission
Ignition, detonate
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, don't talk about it
No, please don't talk about it
Oh no, don't talk about it
Not one more word about it
Oh no, don't think about it
No, please don't think about it
Oh, please don't think about it
It goes away
[Chorus]
Who made these promises?
You made these promises
Erase (erase), replace (replace)
Erase (erase), replace
We'll make more promises
We'll wait for promises
Erase (erase), replace (replace)
Erase (erase), replace

[Verse 2]
A vision, division
Revision, recognate
An action, a reaction
Distraction, question fate
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, don't talk about it
No, please don't talk about it
Oh no, don't talk about it
It goes away
[Chorus]
Who made these promises?
You made these promises
Erase (erase), replace (replace)
Erase (erase), replace
We'll make more promises
We'll wait for promises
Erase (erase), replace (replace)
Erase (erase), replace
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, we're better off now
It's the only thing left said
Meant for you
Oh, oh, I'm better off now
It's the only thing left said
Meant for you

[Chorus]
Who made these promises?
You made these promises
Erase (erase), replace (replace)
Erase (erase), replace
We'll make more promises
We'll wait for promises
Erase (erase), replace (replace)
Erase (erase), replace
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Erase (erase), replace (replace)
Erase (erase), replace
