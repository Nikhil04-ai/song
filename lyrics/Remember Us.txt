Title: Remember Us?
Artist: Crush
[Chorus: Fat Nick]
I'm too rich for that, spent it, too much cash
Blew a, blew a bag, poppin' too, too, too much xans
Syrup overfull, my chain is too, too cool
Too, too high she drool, bitch, I'm too, too hot for you
I'm too rich for that, spent it, too much cash
Blew a, blew a bag, poppin' too, too, too much xans
Syrup overfull, my chain is too, too cool
Too, too high she drool, bitch, I'm too, too hot for you
[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
Skrrt, skrrt, blowing wind
The 30 made them bodies drop
I got money, I got drugs and I got lots of thots
Designer stepping, when I walk I got the Glock hot
Codeine overflow, my kidneys gone, my liver shot
All of my diamonds they flooded on me
I got percs and that lean and got smoke by the P
If you want it, you get it, the uzi by me
And my bankrolls are heavy they covering me
Prada step, flex
Lexus on my neck
Your checks on percs, I spent
She suck me, fuck me then I left
[Chorus: Fat Nick]
I'm too rich for that, spent it, too much cash
Blew a, blew a bag, poppin' too, too, too much xans
Syrup overfull, my chain is too, too cool
Too, too high she drool, bitch, I'm too, too hot for you
I'm too rich for that, spent it, too much cash
Blew a, blew a bag, poppin' too, too, too much xans
Syrup overfull, my chain is too, too cool
Too, too high she drool, bitch, I'm too, too hot for you

[Verse 2: Pouya]
Kick me to the curb, I don't need no one but myself
I got a Glock in my backpack and I will kindly take your health
And that's word to Shakewell
And it occurs to me that I'm undefeated
Took a xanax and I missed a panic
'Cause I couldn't manage, started stumbling
Don't shake my hand when you come up to me
I'm not really the talkative type
Baby stop trippin', start doing that thing with your tongue
That you know that I like
These backwards rappers, going forward with my style
There's inspiration, then there's plagiarism my little child
[Chorus: Fat Nick]
I'm too rich for that, spent it, too much cash
Blew a, blew a bag, poppin' too, too, too much xans
Syrup overfull, my chain is too, too cool
Too, too high she drool, bitch, I'm too, too hot for you
I'm too rich for that, spent it, too much cash
Blew a, blew a bag, poppin' too, too, too much xans
Syrup overfull, my chain is too, too cool
Too, too high she drool, bitch, I'm too, too hot for you
