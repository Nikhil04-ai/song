Title: My Funny Valentine
Artist: Etta James
[Verse]
My funny Valentine
Sweet, comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
, oh...
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
[Refrain]
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, 
Are you smart? Oh...
[Chorus]
But, don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little Valentine, stay
Each day 
is
 Valentine's Day
[Interlude: Flugelhorn solo by Ronnie Buttacavoli]
[Refrain]
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, 
Are you smart? Oh...

[Chorus]
But, don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little Valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's
Each day is Valentine's
Each day is Valentine's Day
