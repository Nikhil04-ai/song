Title: Blobfish
Artist: Olivia Rodrigo
[Intro: Olivia Rodrigo, 
Madison Hu
 & 
Both
]
This song goes out to a guy that doesn't get a lot of love (
No love
)
Probably because he was voted the world's ugliest creature (
Ugly
)
But these two girls think you got it goin' on
This one's for you, blob fish
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse: Madison Hu & 
Olivia Rodrigo
]
When I first saw you, blob fish
I said, "I really like your smile"
Okay, that picture's not your best one
And that drool is pretty vile
Boy, I think you are perfect
 (Perfect)
Just wanna get closer to you
 (
Ugh
)
Maybe not that close, my love
I can see all of your goo
[Outro: Olivia Rodrigo & Madison Hu]
Blob fish, you're endangered
Of breaking my heart
Oh
