Title: I Want You To Know
Artist: John Legend
[Intro]
Ayy
Oh, oh
[Verse 1]
Layin' on the couch, I couldn't not stare
How'd I get so lucky? Got you right there
Lookin' like a movie when you don't care
And even then you reel me in
I know this is something you ain't used to
I ain't gonna hurt you like you used to
You got reservations, I'ma come through
And even then you reel me in
[Pre-Chorus]
You love second guessing
Your every second and every move
You don't need to question
The feeling that I have for you
[Chorus]
Don't want you to wonder
I want you to know
I'm not like the others, I ain't gonna pick up and go
Don't want you to wonder
I want you to know
As long as I'm breathing
Just know that you're never alone

[Post-Chorus]
Don't want you to wonder
I want you to, I want you to, I want you to know
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
) I want you to, I want you to know
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
)
[Verse 2]
I'd love to take a trip inside of your mind
Wonder what I see and what I might find
I wanna find the cheat codes underneath those
Pretty brown eyes, wanna know why
[Pre-Chorus]
You love second guessing
Your every second and every move
You don't need to question
The feeling that I have for you
[Chorus]
Don't want you to wonder
I want you to know
I'm not like the others, I ain't gonna pick up and go
Don't want you to wonder
I want you to know
As long as I'm breathing
Just know that you're never alone

[Post-Chorus]
Don't want you to wonder (Wonder)
I want you to, I want you to, I want you to know
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
) I want you to, I want you to know
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
) Yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
You don't have to wonder, no
No, no, no, no
And you don't have to wonder, no
No, no, no, no
You don't have to wonder, no (
You don't have to wonder
)
No, no
I wanna find the cheat codes underneath those
Pretty brown eyes, oh, baby, I
[Chorus]
I want you to know
I'm not like the others, I ain't gonna pick up and go
Don't want you to wonder
I want you to know
As long as I'm breathing
Just know that you're never alone
[Post-Chorus]
Don't want you to wonder (Wonder)
I want you to, I want you to, I want you to know
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
) I want you to, I want you to know
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
) I want you to know
