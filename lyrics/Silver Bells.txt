Title: Silver Bells
Artist: John Legend
Silver, (Silver bells) silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city, oh
Ring-a-ling, (Ring-a-ling) hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Oh they're playing
Silver bells, silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city (La la la la la la)
Ring-a-ling, (Ring-a-ling) hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day, ah
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blinking bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures, yeah

Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big day
And above all the bustle you hear
Oh they're playing
Silver bells, silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city (La la la la la la)
Ring-a-ling, (Ring-a-ling) hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day, ah
Soon we will come together
We'll learn to love each other
Just like those silver bells playing
And people around the word can dance to the sound
Of Christmas day
Silver bells, silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city (La la la la la la)
Ring-a-ling, (Ring-a-ling) hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas, come on now
Yeah, soon it will be Christmas, woah
Christmas, Christmas day, yeah
Soon it will be Christmas day, yeah
