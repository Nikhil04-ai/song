Title: Close Another Door
Artist: Bee Gees
The final track on Bee Gees' 1st, brothers Robin and Barry explore themes of life, death and mortality, bringing their debut album to a melancholic but hopeful end.
[Intro: Robin Gibb]
Many years have passed, it seems
And now I am all alone
I've sent the children far away
To some obscure unknown
It's so sad, so sad
[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
Close another door
Listen to my eyes
Close another door
You're much too old to work
So won't you run away?
[Post-Chorus: Robin Gibb]
When I was young, I used to say
That age won't bother me
The life I had was very sad
It all went out to sea
So so sad, so sad
[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
[Post Chorus 2: Robin Gibb]
And though the sun is in outside
The rain is in my hair
Now all my life is lived inside
My home is there in my chair

So so sad, so sad
[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
[Outro: Robin Gibb]
Let me go, send me flowers
And put me on a plane
I've paid before
So I've been told at least I'm still alive
Fly me young, fly [?]
And get me up
I been working so, so very hard
At being young but now I'm out of time
I'm out, take me home mama
Said I'm worth it, worth it, worth it
I survive
