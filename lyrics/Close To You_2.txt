Title: Close To You
Artist: Lady Gaga
 
[Chorus]
Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be close to you
[Pre-Chorus]
On the day that you were born, the angels got together and decided to create a dream come true
So, they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue
[Chorus]
That is why (That is why) all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (All around)
Just like me, they long to be close to you
[Pre-Chorus]
On the day that you were born, the angels got together and decided to create a dream come true
So, 
they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue, oh-hoo
[Chorus]
That is why (That is why) all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you (Follow you) all around (All around)
Just like me, they long to be so close to you
Oh, just like me, they long to be so close to you
Just like me, they long to be so close to you
