Title: Gangsta Shit
Artist: OutKast
OutKast asks us if we want to hear about some gangsta shit, then proceeds to rap about it without waiting for an answer. Off of Stankonia.
[Intro: Big Boi]
Some of that uh, LTD Lincoln Town Car
Some of that El Dorado funk, know what I'm talking about?
Gangsta shit, you know? Lay back, cool out, yeah
You know we keep it crunk around here, A-town style
Getting head on the highways, yeah
,
But, this what I wanna know...
[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
OutKast, Goodie Mob, and the Dungeon clique
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Dirty South, nigga, we straight gangsta pimps
[Verse 1: Big Boi]
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, O-N-P, G-Double O-D-I-E
, 
so fresh so clean
Back with 
Stankonia
, 
Dungeon Family-ee
Pearl Cadillac on D's and 
Vogues
, flip flops, T-shirts and Dickies
It's the return of Billy Ocean
, 
Cuervo is my drink
Stank-stank means you got the funkiest, dopest heat on the street
Three G ski, Slimm, Big Boi and this is C B-O-N-E
If you need some back-up, find your own
Ya girl gonna give you grief at home
Just tell her these hoes wanna be on the same team that she's playing on

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
OutKast, Goodie Mob, and the Dungeon clique
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?

Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Dirty South, nigga, we straight gangsta pimps
[Verse 2: C-Bone + 
Big Boi
]
Dope boys in the trap like to stack the dough
When beef come around, can't let it go
When my funds turn legit, I'ma let you know
,
Ridin' rims real good down Old National
, it's trappable—
Two bed, Jacuzzi bath
, it's natural—
Puttin' cheese in ya stash
, un-taxable—
Futhermuckers get mad
, 
steady watching myself, got eyes in my back
Don't take no slack when you managing the trap
, 
if you work out, gotta get it right back
I trap by day, boy, rap by night
,
C-Bone in this bitch, College Park trump tight
[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
OutKast, Goodie Mob, and the Dungeon clique
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Dirty South, nigga, we straight gangsta pimps

[Verse 3: T-Mo Goodie]
I'm pimp tight, give a fuck, niggas know what's up
It's T-Mo and OutKast, in the back of my truck
We gotta simple little problem that we got to solve
It like it ain't about the money, we got to handle the job
No colors or rags, just guns and masks
We not scared to blast and dip off fast
With the Dungeon clique, just pulled a lick
Now what you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
OutKast, Goodie Mob, and the Dungeon clique
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Dirty South nigga we straight gangsta pimps
[Verse 4: Slimm Calhoun]
Back on the scene, a sack of green, sitting on chrome and rubber bands
Paint looking like Candyland
, 
it's Slimm, the southpaw triggerman
Flippin' work and whippin' weight, rock up, roll, and get the papes
Chop them hoes and then you skate, back to the block wit' the deflate
Grams the O's, slabes to whole one's da flake
A young nigga holdin', big face foldin'
Pimps are known for catching runaways
A good hustler's known to keep his gun away
First nigga run up and try to jack mine –
First nigga fuck up to get flat-lined
Pack still, stainless Coupe and Verts brainless
Y'all don't wanna fuck wit' me, 
the trunk be bangin'
Off the chain, danglin', y'all know that I'm from 
CP
(When do ya shoot, boy? Shot don’t reverse
Send to the downtown, send for the nurse)

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
OutKast, Goodie Mob, and the Dungeon clique
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Dirty South, nigga, we straight gangsta pimps
[Verse 5: André 3000]
OutKast with a K, yeah, them niggas are hard
Harder than a nigga tryna impress God
We'll pull your whole deck, fuck pulling your card
And still take my guitar and take a walk in the park
And play the sweetest melody the street ever heard
Now bitches sucking on my nouns and 
I'm eating their verbs
Get full, and niggas, niggas, 
pop, pop, lock, lock to the, to the beat, beat
 
as if pitbulls went out of style
Made a vow to myself – if it's for the wealth, I'll stop
Well, put it like this – 
it's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop
Wrong reason, whatever the season, hey winter, spring, summer, or fall
I dont stall, slow drag wit' your brain against the wall
Yeah, nigga, naw, we lean to the side, don't fall
All y'all fuckboys tuck toys inside your pants
Just to pull it out, point it at the ground, and make a nigga wanna dance
Now what that be for? You're on that reefer
And on that 2Pac
, in front of them ooh-wops
Trying to show out, that's the ho route
Talking loud, talking 'bout, "That's gangsta shit"
