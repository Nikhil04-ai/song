Title: Bluebird
Artist: Lana Del Rey
[Verse]
Little bird,
 
bluebird
Fly away for both of us
For you have wings, and I've no means to fly
Little bird,
 
bluebird
Find some strength inside my hand
Anything to let you sing goodbye
[Pre-Chorus]
For your thoughts are small, they can't keep you from leavin'
As the wake of my past crashes in
I hear the door slam, but the window's wide open
We both shouldn't be dealing with him
[Chorus]
Find a way to fly
Find a way to fly
Just shoot for the sun 'til I can finally run
Find a way to fly
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
I've kept him at bay, but the horses are comin'
They're racin' their way 
'round the bend
Your crash landing's over, but the 
evening is hummin'
Don't make me say it again

[Chorus]
Find a way to fly
Find a way to fly
Just shoot for the sun 'til I can finally run
Find a way to fly
[Outro]
Mhm
Mhm
Just shoot for the sun 'til I can finally run
Find a way to fly
