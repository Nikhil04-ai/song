Title: Let’s Dance
Artist: David Bowie
 
[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
[Refrain]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
[Verse 1]
(Let's dance)
 
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
 To the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway) While colour lights up your face
(Let's sway) Sway through the crowd to an empty space
[Chorus]
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower
[Refrain]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
[Verse 2]
(Let's dance)
 For fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance)
 For fear tonight is all
(Let's sway) You could look into my eyes
(Let's sway) Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight

[Chorus]
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower
[Refrain]
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
[Verse 3]
(Let's dance)
 Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance)
 To the song we're playing
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway) Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
(Let's dance)
(Let's)
(Let's)
(Let's)
(Let's sway)
(Let's)
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
(Let's dance)
Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
