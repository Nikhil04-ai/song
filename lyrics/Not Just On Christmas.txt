Artist: Ariana Grande
Â 
[Chorus]
I'll love you 'til I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby, I adore you
Not just on Christmas
Wanna show you in so many ways
Three hundred sixty-five days
I'll give you all my presents, boy, I'm for you
Not just on Christmas
[Verse]
Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice
I'm by your side
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah
Ah
[Chorus]
I'll love you 'til I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby, I adore you
Not just on Christmas

[Verse]
Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice
I'm by your side
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah
Ah
