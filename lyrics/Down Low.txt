[Intro]
Can I get to know you babe?
[Chorus]
Can I get to know you babe?
Show you things these niggas see in dreams
But just don't tell your team
Keep it on the down low, keep-keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low
Keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low
Keep it on the down low
Down low, keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low-low-low-low-low
[Verse 1]
No rush though baby, I'll be your shawty body
I'll let you do the naughty, make me go, "La-di-dadi"
Don't tell them secrets, I'll give 'em reasons to keep 'em bae
But this ain't creeping, nah ah, this is just freakin'
Papa, see you every weekend, ah ah
And I'm speakin', you and me can make sure ain't nobody peekin'
So can I get to know?
[Chorus]
Can I get to know you babe?
Show you things these niggas see in dreams
But just don't tell your team
Keep it on the down low, keep-keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low
Keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low
Keep it on the down low
Down low, keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low-low-low-low-low

[Verse 2]
So touch me baby, let's get this party started
I'll show you how I ride it, let you know I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
You got me fiendin', a perfect reason for pleasin' babe
I hear you breathin' in my ear, you got me screamin' babe
Baby boy I'm tryin' to know ya
See the shotgun that you hide in ya holster
We can get down on the ground or the sofa
Do you got time for an hour of Doja
?
So many things that I'm dyin' to show ya
No pics when it's time for exposure
Just ridin' over and over and over and over
[Chorus]
Can I get to know you babe?
Show you things these niggas see in dreams
But just don't tell your team
Keep it on the down low, keep-keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low
Keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low
Keep it on the down low
Down low, keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low-low-low-low-low
[Bridge]
Just don't say a thing, we'll be safe on the low
Let them wonder, babe, mystery keeps us close
Just don't say a thing, we'll be safe on the low
Let them wonder, babe, mystery keeps us close

[Chorus]
Can I get to know you babe?
Show you things these niggas see in dreams
But just don't tell your team
Keep it on the down low, keep-keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low
Keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low
Keep it on the down low
Down low, keep it on the down low
Low, low, low, low-low-low-low-low
