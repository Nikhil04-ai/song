Title: Empty Handed
Artist: Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
Blast on mirror tell or said
Blast in weapon wear it all away
Empty handed
Empty handed
[Verse 2]
Pillow to rest a little in the soul
Bread or stone into would
Empty handed
Empty handed
[Chorus]
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
[Verse 1]
Blast on mirror tell or said
Blast in weapon wear it all away
Empty handed
Empty handed

[Verse 2]
Pillow to rest a little in the soul
Bread or stone into would
Empty handed
Empty handed
[Chorus]
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
[Outro]
Wow!
