Title: Just One of Those Things
Artist: Frank Sinatra
[Verse 1]
It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things
[Verse 2]
It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on 
gossamer wings
Just one of those things
[Chorus]
If we'd thought a bit 'bout the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down
[Chorus]
So goodbye, dear, and Amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things
[Verse 2]
It was just, just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

[Chorus]
If we'd thought of it 'bout the end of it
When we started painting that town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down
[Chorus]
So goodbye, goodbye, bye, bye, goodbye, baby, and Amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things
