Title: Safe With Me
Artist: Sam Smith
 
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
If you ever need me
Just tell me, and I’ll be there
‘Cause I was built for you
Yes, I was built to carry all your feelings
[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause I won’t let them know
I won’t let you go, baby
I don’t care what your past is
I don’t need no answers
Just have faith in me
[Hook]
Don’t you know your secret’s safe with me?
(My heart it would beat, my heart it would beat, beat)
All your worries can be put to, can be put to sleep
(My heart, it would beat, beat)
Don’t you know your secret’s safe with me?
(My heart it would beat, my heart it would beat, beat)
All your worries can be put to sleep
(My heart, it would beat, beat)
[Verse 2]
No need to step back
Don’t be scared, I got you, you know that
I’m here when you’re sad
When all of your clouds turn black

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause I won’t let them know
I won’t let you go, baby
I don’t care what your past is
I don’t need no answers
Just have faith in me
[Hook]
Don’t you know your secret’s safe with me?
(My heart it would beat, my heart it would beat, beat)
All your worries can be put to, can be put to sleep
(My heart, it would beat, beat)
Don’t you know your secret’s safe with me?
(My heart it would beat, my heart it would beat, beat)
All your worries can be put to sleep, can be put to sleep
(My heart, it would beat, beat)
