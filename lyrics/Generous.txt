Title: Generous
Artist: Doja Cat
 
[Intro]
Give it right back, daddy, give right back (Uh)
This look pretty, can I sit right back?
On it, give it right back
Baby, do ya like that? (Uh)
Take that from me when I give that back
Wait, give it right back, daddy, give right back (Uh)
This look pretty, can I sit right back?
On it, give it right back
Baby, do ya like that? (Uh)
[Verse 1]
Baby, I know you've seen it in my eyes
I got a lot for you, and deeper than you know
Never thought 'bout how you give so damn much
What I've taken from you, I can give right back, 'cause
[Chorus]
I feel like, I feel like you deserve me
I'm feeling generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
No need to persuade, promise you're doing enough, so
I'm feeling gеnerous, I'd give, give you whatеver you want
Generous, I'd give, give you whatever you—
Generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
[Bridge]
Take that from me when I give that back
Wait, give it right back, daddy, give it right back (Uh)
This look pretty, can I sit right back?
On it, give it right back
Baby, do ya like that? (Uh)
I, I, I, I can do many things, many things, many things (Yo)

[Verse 2]
I could probably cater to you
I might be lookin' like a waiter to you
And all them niggas I was talking to
I keep them off the radar for you
'Cause they do nothing they say they gon' do
And I be feelin' like a dog the way I'm pacin', sittin', waitin' for you
Just contemplating all the naughty shit I'm waitin' to do
And I can lay that out on the table for you
I want to fuck just like we came straight from the zoo
And they don't make them like him anymore
Feel bad for these niggas, competition's very strong
I bust the longest mission for some missionary raw
He could make a mess and tell me, "Lick it off the floor" (Shit)
[Chorus]
I feel like, I feel like you deserve me
I'm feeling generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
No need to persuade, promise you're doing enough, so
I'm feeling generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
Generous, I'd give, give you whatever you—
Generous, I'd give, give you whatever you want
