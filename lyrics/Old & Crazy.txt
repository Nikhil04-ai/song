Title: Old & Crazy
Artist: Bruno mars
Track 11 on “Unorthodox Jukebox”, Old & Crazy is a playful jaunt that finds Bruno really going retro — as in, saloon piano and jazz-era horns.



The track features Esperanza Spalding.
[Chorus: Esperanza Spaulding & 
Bruno Mars
]
Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty, when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?
[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Will you still hold my hand
When my clothes are out of style?
My teeth all ran away
And I don't have the same smile
[Chorus: Esperanza Spaulding & 
Bruno Mars
]
Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty, when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2: Esperanza Spaulding]
Will you still want to dance
Even if my hips are weak
My ears don't hear so well
And I can't find the beat?

[Chorus: Esperanza Spaulding & 
Bruno Mars
]
Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty, when my hair's grey?
Will you still call me baby, when I'm old and crazy?
