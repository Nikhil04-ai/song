Title: Khashoggi’s Ship
Artist: Queen
 
[Segue: Verse]
Who said that my party was all over?
Huh, huh, I'm in pretty good shape
The best years of my life are like a supernova
Huh, huh, perpetual craze, I said that!
Everybody drank my wine, you get my drift
And then we took a holiday on Khashoggi's Ship, well
We really had a good, good time
They was all so sexy
We was bad, we was blitzed
All in all, it was a pretty good trip
[Hook]
This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head
Wanted to get me, I said, "Go away"
I said, "Kiss my ass, honey"
He pulled out a gun, wanted to arrest me
I said, "Uh, uh, baby"
Now listen no-one stops my (Party)
No-one stops my (Party)
No-one, no-one, no-one stops my (Party)
Just like I said
We were phased, we was pissed
Just havin' a total eclipse
[Bridge]
Bup bup, badabup, badibup bup bup
Bedabup bedadee hey
That's good
Oooh
Wooh wooh wooh
Wooh wooh wooh, hah!
This one's on me, so let us do it just right
This here one party don't get started 'till midnight

[Outro]
Hey! Hah!
Everybody's party to the left, party to the right
Lay mine in the middle, do it all night, alright alright, hey
Two within the middle with you, we're going buddy
(Hey uhh, hey huh)
Alright, hey
Left, right, left, right
No one stops my, aaahh!
