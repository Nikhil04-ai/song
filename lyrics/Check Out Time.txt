Title: Check Out Time
Artist: Tupac Shakur
2Pac and his crew woke up in a hotel after a late night and recap the night in this song.

Natasha Walker also sung the hook in Thug Life’s Shit Don’t Stop and did back up vocals on Bury Me a G.
[Intro: 2Pac, 
Kurupt
 & 
Syke
]
Ayy, what time is it, nigga?
I don't know
Oh shit, 12 o'clock? Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here (Hell, yeah)
Damn
Nigga, it's check out time, nigga
Hey, call up Kurupt, call Daz room
Hey there, bitch, where Suge at, nigga?
Call Suge, call all the niggas, tell 'em to meet me downstairs
Where K and them niggas at, man?
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
Ayy, y'all seen my shoes?
Hey, Kurupt, y'all niggas drivin' or y'all flyin' back, what's up?
Ayy, nigga, you seen my— where the keys at, man?
Man, I'm rollin', man, fuck that shit
Who got the keys?
Ayy, Syke, nigga, come on, man, get up out the bathroom, fool
Fuck that
I lost some money, nigga
Ahh, nigga
Damn
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers
 while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holler to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us? Plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantasy, some Alizé and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, 'til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scene
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems
, it's check out time

[Chorus: Natasha Walker & 
2Pac
]
We gotta go (
Gotta go, gotta go
)
We gotta go (
Yeah, baby, haha, it's check out time
)
We gotta go (
Gotta go, nigga, gotta go
)
We gotta go (
Y'all know what time it is
)
We gotta go (
Ayy, come on, man, get y'all bags, man, call that valet motherfucker
)
We gotta go (
Tell him to get a nigga shit, 'cause we out this motherfucker
)
[Verse 2: Kurupt]
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantasies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight
So I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant massage, sip wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up, and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night
I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Michael Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
Cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
'Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

[Chorus: Natasha Walker, 
Kurupt
 & 
Priest
]
We gotta go (
Ayo man, Pac, ayy, where the f— where the fuck is Daz at, man?
)
We gotta go (
This nigga locked up or somethin'
)
We gotta go (
Don't even wanna leave
)
We gotta go (
Yo, man, it's check out time, it's time to get out this motherfucker
)
We gotta go (
Ayy, you see them bitches?
)
We gotta go (
We out, man, fuck that shit
)
We gotta go (
Yo Priest
)
We gotta go (
Yo, nigga, what's up? Where's Syke?
)
[Verse 3: Big Syke]
Hey, I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behavior is crazy from what you did to me, baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the Jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin' your thoughts, 'cause I'm livin' fed, heard what I said?
Passion is crashin' the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out "Big Syke, Daddy"
We did it in the Caddy on the Highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight from 'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up, baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

[Chorus: Natasha Walker & 
Big Syke
]
We gotta go, we gotta go
(
Ayy, it's check out time
)
We gotta go (
Ayy, Pac, nigga, where my motherfuckin'—
)
We gotta go (
Where my shoes go, nigga?
)
We gotta go (
Where my motherfuckin' drawers and shit at, man?
)
We gotta go (
Man, y'all niggas was in here partyin' too fuckin' much
)
We gotta go (
What the fuck y'all doin', nigga?
)
We gotta go (
Kurupt, go tell Daz, man, and Bogart and the rest of them niggas
)
We gotta go (
Kurupt, go tell Daz, man, and Bogart and the rest of them niggas
)
We gotta go (
Come on, man, niggas is trippin', man
)
(
Front desk all callin' me, tellin' me to get the hell outta here, man
)
We gotta go (
I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred
)
We gotta go, we gotta go
We gotta go, we gotta go
We gotta go, we gotta go
We gotta go
Ooh, we gotta go
Ooh-we, hey
We, we gotta go
Hey, we gotta go
Hey, mhm, yeah, uh-huh
