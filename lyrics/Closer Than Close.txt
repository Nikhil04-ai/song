Title: Closer Than Close
Artist: Bee Gees
[Verse 1: Maurice Gibb]
She'll read your mind, she's smart as a whip
She'll suck you dry, but look at how much I drip?
At the point of ecstasy
I write a symphony of poetry in motion
And leavin' me there to die
[Verse 2: Maurice Gibb & 
Bee Gees
]
I tell myself let no one take her place
To confide in someone, and look at how much I paid?
I want you next to me, call it telepathy
We drifted into vision, and look at how much we see?
(Ah, ah-ah)
[Chorus: Bee Gees & 
Maurice Gibb
]
I just wanna get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other any test of my faith will do
And lovers fall for lovers' friends
We make each other cry livin' in each other's lives
And tryna make the fantasy come true
I just wanna get closer than close to you
Baby, I just wanna get closer than close to you
[Verse 3: Maurice Gibb, 
Bee Gees
]
Your soul is naked, it tells you what you want
I read your letter, and look at how close I've come?
There's more for us to see in this philosophy
We both end up in Heaven, and look at how close we'd be
(
Ah, ah-ah
)

[Chorus: Bee Gees & 
Maurice Gibb
]
I just wanna get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other any test of my faith will do
I give my heart for you to break, I give my final breath
Nothin' last forever, see
We can turn eternity into
[Bridge: Bee Gees]
I just wanna get closer than close to you
To the moment you discover what the best of my love can do
And lovers fall for lovers' friends
We make each other cry livin' in each other's lives
And tryna make the fantasy come true
I just wanna get closer than close to you
Baby, I just wanna get closer than close to you
[Outro: Bee Gees]
I just wanna get closer than close to you
(I just wanna get closer than close to you)
(My love)
To the moment you discover what the best of my love can do
(My love)
Baby, I just wanna get closer than close to you
(I just wanna get closer than close to you)
(My love)
I know that one way or the other any test of my faith will do
(My love)
Baby, I just wanna get closer than close to you
