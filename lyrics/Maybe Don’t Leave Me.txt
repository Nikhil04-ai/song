Title: Maybe Donâ€™t Leave Me
Artist: Billie Eilish
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
So you wanna give up on us?
Wager all we had on lust
Sorry that I'm not enough for you
Settle for a careless love
Tarnish everything you touch
Sorry that I'm not enough for you, you
[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Brandon Colbein]
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
So maybe don't leave me this way
[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Brandon Colbein]
They always make it sound so easy
Just stop the singing, start the healing
Like you shouldn't be defeated
By him leaving for no reason, ay
[Chorus: Billie Eilish & Brandon Colbein]
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
So maybe don't leave me this way

[Bridge: Brandon Colbein & Billie Eilish]
Don't you treat me like a fool
Don't you treat me like a foolish child
Soon as I get over you
You're telling me "Come over, stay a while"
A while, a while, a while, a while, a while, a while
[Chorus: Brandon Colbein & Billie Eilish]
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay (mmm)
Now you know you need me
Call me when your heart breaks
Tell me that you made a mistake
Saying that you couldn't stay
Now you know you need me
So maybe don't leave me this way
