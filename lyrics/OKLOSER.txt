Title: OKLOSER
Artist: Doja Cat
[Chorus]
I say okay, okay, loser (Okay, loser)
We go way, way back, I won't say, "Okay, boomer" (Okay, okay)
Ain’t shit sweet, I brush my teeth, but still my tooth hurt (Still my tooth hurt, hey, hey)
You cannot come to the cookout, get your hand up out the cooler
 (Cooler, bitch)
She was in my seat, I had to scooch her (I had to scooch her, I had to)
She was at her knees, I had to boot her (I had to boot her)
She just left the team like we ain't knew her (Like we ain't knew her, bitch)
She just left the team like, okay, loser
[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah (Okay, loser)
I ain’t all on my lonesome, they want me to loan some
I made a fortune, they can't let that go none
I'm doin' so much, that shit cost a shoulder
I don't blow it all on a VVS boulder
I put the verse in the motherfuckin' 'ace
I put the grr in they motherfuckin' top teeth
Rock on my hand make The Rock wanna rock me
Flock to the stands ’cause my opp always watchin’
[Chorus]
I say okay, okay, loser (Okay, loser)
We go way, way back, I won't say, "Okay, boomer" (Okay, okay)
Ain’t shit sweet, I brush my teeth, but still my tooth hurt (Still my tooth hurt, hey, hey)
You cannot come to the cookout, get your hand up out the cooler (Cooler, bitch)
She was in my seat, I had to scooch her (I had to scooch her, I had to)
She was at her knees, I had to boot her (I had to boot her)
She just left the team like we ain't knew her (Like we ain't knew her, bitch)
She just left the team like, okay, loser, okay loser

[Verse 2]
And I said loser, loser, loser
Why the fuck these bitches always comin' out the woodwork?
Don’t know why she mad 'cause, bitch, ain't nothin' I did to her
She just out here plottin' on my ass, I call her Stewart
She the lowest
, she so down and out, I'll sue her
Grow the fuck up, act your age, you immature
Maybe one day, you gon' create some allure
Maybe one day, you'll be great and go on tour
Like me, hey
[Chorus]
Okay, okay, loser (Okay, loser)
We go way, way back, I won't say, "Okay, boomer" (Okay, okay)
Ain't shit sweet, I brush my teeth, but still my tooth hurt (Still my tooth hurt, hey, hey)
You cannot come to the cookout, get your hand up out the cooler (Cooler, bitch)
She was in my seat, I had to scooch her (I had to scooch her, I had to)
She was at her knees, I had to boot her (I had to boot her)
She just left the team like we ain't knew her (Like we ain't knew her, bitch)
She just left the team like, okay, loser
Okay, loser, ayy
[Outro]
Okay, okay (Loser)
Gon' leave me alone
Okay, okay (Loser)
You need me, I know
Okay, okay (Loser)
Ain't givin' you none
Okay, okay (Loser)
Gon' leave me alone
Okay, okay (Loser)
Gon' leave me alone
Okay, okay (Loser)
You need me, I know
Ain't givin' you none, none
