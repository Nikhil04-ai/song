Title: That’s Entertainment
Artist: Lady Gaga
 
[Intro]
Everything that happens in life
Can happen in a show
You can make 'em laugh, you can make 'em cry
Anything, anything can go
[Chorus]
The clown with his pants falling down
Or the dance, that's a dream of romance
Or the scene where the villain is mean
That's entertainment
The lights on the lady in tights
Or the bride with a guy on the side
Or the ball where she gives it her all
That's entertainment
[Verse 1]
The plot can be hot, simply teeming with sex
A gay divorcée who is after her ex
It can be Oedipus Rex
Where a chap kills his 
mother
 and causes a lot of bother
The clerk who is thrown out of work
By the boss who is thrown for a loss
By the skirt who is doing him dirt
The world is a stage
The stage is a world of entertainment

[Bridge]
That's entertainment
That's entertainment
[Saxophone Solo]
[Chorus]
The doubt while the jury is out
Or the thrill when they're reading the will
Or the chase for the man with the face
That's entertainment
No death like you get in 
Macbeth
No ordeal like the end of Camille
This goodbye brings a tear to the eye
That's entertainment
[Verse 2]
Admit it's a hit and we'll go on from there
We played a charade that was lighter than air
A good old-fashioned affair
As I sing this finale I hope it's up your alley
[Outro]
The gag may be wearing a flag
That began with a 
Mr. Cohan
Hip hooray! The American way
The world is a stage
The stage is a world of entertainment
