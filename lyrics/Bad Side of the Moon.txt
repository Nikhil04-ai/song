Title: Bad Side of the Moon
Artist: Elton John
[Verse 1]
It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like a hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue
[Chorus]
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
[Chorus 2]
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
[Verse 2]
There isn't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

[Chorus 1]
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
[Chorus 2]
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
