Title: Plastic Bag
Artist: Ed Sheeran
[Verse 1]
I overthink and have trouble sleepin'
All purpose gone and don't have a reason
And there's no doctor to stop this bleedin'
So I left home and jumped in the deep end
Took a job for dad, I think, just to please him
So, when I quit, I just kept it secret
And I had friends, but no longer see them
And it's just me and, now, all my demons
[Pre-Chorus]
Are heavy, weighin' on my heart
I guess I'm done already, all but given up
I'm burnin' days till the weekends
And starts, I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?
[Chorus]
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rеly on the strobe lights
The lifеline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
[Verse 2]
My friend died, it's been years, still grievin'
And I thought time would be somehow healin'
When love finds me, I'm too numb to feel it
Oh, why the fuck am I still here breathin'?
Well, I would pray, but I don't believe it
Oh, woe is me, but I don't care either
Life is not the way that it seems, but
Maybe this will all be a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll stay steady, balance on the rope
I guess that I'm not ready to rely on the hope
I'm burnin' days till the weekends
And starts, I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?
[Chorus]
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
[Bridge]
I'm a wreck-head, ah
Take me to the other side
Don't look in my eyes, oh, woah
[Verse 3]
It's almost mornin', I'm still not leavin'
It's wearin' off, but I still can feel it
Another one and I'll touch the ceilin'
This is all I want to be

[Chorus]
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is givin' me a reason to rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass and I'll take that
If you're givin' out love from a plastic bag
