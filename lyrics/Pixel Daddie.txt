Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
(How you made me feel)
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
(How you made me feel)
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
I don't remember what you said, but I remember how you made me feel (Yeah)
I like my dollars like cement
Walk all over it and you see how it feels
Forgive me
Give me, now
Forgive me
Give me, now
Remember what you said
Don’t remember how you made me feel
Kiss me, pixel daddy (Oh)
Get up in the day (Oh)
No one's more than you are (What you want)
Do you want a babe?
Do you want a babe?
Do you want a babe?
Do you want a.. baby?

I don't remember what you said
But I remember how you made me feel
(Remember how you made me feel)
I like my dollars like cement
Walk all over it and you see how it feels
Forgive me
Give me, now
Forgive me
Give me, now
Remember what you said
Don’t remember how you made me feel
(Remember it)
