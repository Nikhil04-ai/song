Title: Diamonds Are Forever
Artist: Arctic Monkeys
[Verse 1]
Diamonds are forever
They are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
[Verse 2]
Diamonds are forever
Hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see every part
Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
[Chorus]
I don't need love
For what good can love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone
They'll luster on
[Verse 3]
Diamonds are forever
Sparkling 'round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
And men are mere mortals who
Are not worth going to your grave for

[Chorus]
I don't need love
For what good can love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone
They'll luster on
[Outro]
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever
Forever and ever
