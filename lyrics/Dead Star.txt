[Intro]
(Woo!)
[Verse 1]
Shame on you for thinking
You're an exception
We're all to blame
Crashing down to Earth
[Refrain]
Wasting and burning out, yeah
Fading like a dead star, woah-oh
Harm is coming your way
Yeah, it's coming your way
[Chorus]
You used to be everything to me
Now you're tired of fighting (Fighting)
Tired of fighting, fighting yourself
Yourself, yourself, yourself
[Verse 2]
Shame on you for thinking
You're all alone, na-ta-bu-ksch
If you want, I'll make you wish you were
Failing to impress

[Refrain]
Why can't you sleep with
Someone who'll protect you? Yeah
Harm is coming your way
Yeah, it's coming your way
[Chorus]
You used to be everything to me
Now you're tired of fighting (Fighting)
Tired of fighting, fighting yourself
Yourself, yourself, yourself
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Fighting yourself, fighting yourself, fighting
