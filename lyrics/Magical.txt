Title: Magical
Artist: Ed Sheeran
[Verse 1]
One touch, electric shock
Eyes locked, like, did you feel that too?
World stops, just us
Here under dots in the darkness
Of the blue, out of the blue
[Chorus]
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
[Verse 2]
Our lips barely one inch
Your skin brushed by my fingertips
Mornings, white mist
So delicate, covers as we begin
As we begin
[Chorus]
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical

[Post-Chorus]
(
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
)
(
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
)
[Verse 3]
Silence is filled as time stands still
Our thoughts in the open room
Lay here until the sun distils
It's light for the perfect view
Now I'm with you
[Chorus]
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
