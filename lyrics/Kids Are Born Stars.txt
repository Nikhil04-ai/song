Title: Kids Are Born Stars
Artist: Lauv
 
[Verse 1]
I was in love with her, she was in love with me
At least that's what I thought it was, mm
I felt her on my skin, but when the movie ended
She just broke my heart, mm
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did I mean nothin' to you?
Tell me, did I ever have a chance? Mm
[Chorus]
Girl, just kiss me before you miss me
Said someday, I'm gonna be a really big star, uh-uh-uh
Taste the moment before it's done
Before you go and break my heart
You should know I'ma be a really big star
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, thеn it was over
I knew it, just like that
'Causе she stopped textin' back
I cried, but it’s
Cool she didn’t come over
But I knew that someday
I knew I'd be a really, really, really, really big star

[Verse 2]
Way back before DMs, she'd send me AIMs
With less-than-threes for hearts, mm
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did I mean nothin' to you?
Tell me, did I ever have a chance? 'Cause
Oh, yeah, I've been all alone and
Thinkin' way back to that eighth grade dance
Oh, that dance sucked 'cause
[Chorus]
Girl, just kiss me, before you miss me
Said someday, I'm gonna be a really big star, uh-uh-uh
Taste the moment before it's done
Before you go and break my heart
You should know I'ma be a really big star
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, then it was over
I knew it, just like that
'Cause she stopped textin' back
I cried, but it’s
Cool she didn’t come over
But I knew that someday
I knew I'd be a really, really, really, really big star

What's up, Joshua?
Joshua, can you do these lyrics? (
Okay, ready?
)
Can you do them for me?
You should know I'ma be a really big star
Someday, I'm gonna be a big star
Be a really big star
Someday, I'm gonna be a really big star
That's amazing (
Ari, sing it
)
[Chorus]
Girl, just kiss me before you miss me
Said someday, I'm gonna be a really big star, uh-uh-uh
Taste the moment before it's done
Before you go and break my heart
You should know I'ma be a really big star
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, then it was over
I knew it, just like that
'Cause she stopped textin' back
I cried, but it’s
Cool she didn’t come over
But I knew that someday
I knew I'd be a really, really, really, really big star

[Outro]
Haha, just kidding
