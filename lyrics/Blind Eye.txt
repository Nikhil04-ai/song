Title: Blind Eye
Artist: Sam Smith
Â 
[Verse 1]
I hear you call for me with a 
million eyes
You take us gospel but I don't deny
But you won't succeed, 'cause I've been tipped off
I just turned a blind eye
 for way too long
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
People like me don't pick a fight with you
But underneath the bridge we gather 
two by two
If we don't succeed, well, at least we tried
Turned around to face you with a one blind eye
[Chorus]
I'm gonna carry you over (Carry you over)
Pull you in closer (Pull you in closer)
One by one
, 
we marry the night
Sitting on the same boat
 on different sides
Staring at each other with our one blind eye
Ooh-ooh, ooh
One by one (Ooh), we marry the night
(Ooh) Sitting on the same boat (Ooh) on different sides
Staring at each other with our one blind eye
