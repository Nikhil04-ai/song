Title: Close to You
Artist: Frank Sinatra
Close to you
I will always stay
Close to you
Though you're far away
You'll always be near
As though you were here by my side
No matter where
In my dreams, I'll find you there
Close to me
Sharing your caress
Can't you see
You're my happiness?
Wherever you go, my heart will go too
What can I do?
It only wants to be
Close to you
Wherever you go, my heart will go too
What can I do?
If you knew the joy you bring
How my hungry heart would sing
If only we could be close to you
