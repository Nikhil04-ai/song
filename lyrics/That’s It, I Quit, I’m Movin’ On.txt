Title: That’s It, I Quit, I’m Movin’ On
Artist: Adele
[Verse 1]
When we used to say goodnight
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don't seem to care
You close the door
And leave me standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on
[Verse 2]
The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on
Oooohhhh
[Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble and fall
But if I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all

[Verse 3]
Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love everything you got
Though your kisses fill me
So if you got someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on
Oooohhhh
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
