Title: Bliss
Artist: Muse
One of Matt Bellamy’s favourites on the album, “Bliss” is about someone admiring somebody so much that their love becomes envying.
[Verse 1]
Everything about you is how I'd wanna be
Your freedom comes naturally
Everything about you resonates happiness
Now I won't settle for less
[Chorus]
Give me all the peace and joy in your mind
Ooh
[Verse 2]
Everything about you pains my envying
Your soul can't hate anything
Everything about you is so easy to love
They're watching you from above
[Chorus]
Give me all the peace and joy in your mind
I want the peace and joy in your mind
Give me the peace and joy in your mind, ooh
[Bridge]
Everything about you resonates happiness
Now I won't settle for less
[Chorus]
Give me all the peace and joy in your mind
I want the peace and joy in your mind
Give me the peace and joy in your mind
Ooh
