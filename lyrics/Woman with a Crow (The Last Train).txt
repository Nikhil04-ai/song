Title: Woman with a Crow (The Last Train)
Artist: Cigarettes After Sex
Woman with a crow
Hides a sleeping potion in her eyes
I'm feeling low
Feeling frustrated
Never know
Now that you're gone I"ll leave a note
Ulalume
Next time I try to kiss you
I'll fall asleep on the last train
& I'll always love you
Ulalume
You would always love me
This time you tried to kiss me
I fell asleep on the last train
