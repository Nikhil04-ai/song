Title: Your Girl
Artist: Lana Del Rey
Â 
[Verse 1]
Carry me off the stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for three years
Is that enough for you boy?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Carry me to my bed, 
paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things that you and I will never do
[Chorus]
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
[Verse 2]
Carry me off the stage
Had too much to drink
Been on tour too long
And I've had too much time to think

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Carry me to my bed
Lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head
And remind me of the way we will not now
[Chorus]
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
[Bridge]
Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, laying in Versailles
You and I get to know one another
Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, baby you and I
Can get to know one another

[Chorus]
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
[Outro]
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
