Artist: Muse
[Verse 1]
Oh I wish that it was sunny
Friends are all we've got to call
And I just swig my bottle
As I've got nowhere left to go
[Chorus]
I just wanna be
Spend some time on my own
[Verse 2]
Oh I wish that it was sunny
And I fell as I dropped out
And I judge you by your future
Hope that drives and can't turn down
[Chorus]
I just wanna be
Spend some time on my own
