Title: Everyone Says ‘Hi’
Artist: David Bowie
 
[Verse 1]
Said you took a big trip, they said you moved away
Happened oh so quietly
, 
they say
Shoulda took a picture, something I could keep
Buy a little frame, something cheap
For you
[Chorus]
Everyone says 'hi'
[Verse 2]
Said you sailed a big ship, said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing to say
I'd love to get a letter, like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good and it's not too hot
For you
[Chorus]
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says
[Post-Chorus]
Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says 'hi'

[Bridge]
If the money is lousy, you can always come home
We can do the old things, we can do all the bad things
If the food gets you leery, you can always phone
We could do all the good things
We could do it, we could do it, we could do it
[Refrain]
Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are
[Chorus]
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
[Outro]
And the girl next door
And the guy upstairs
Everyone says 'hi'
And your mum and dad
Everyone says 'hi'
And your big fat dog
Everyone says 'hi'
Everyone says 'hi'
Hi hi hi hi
