Title: Kill For Love
Artist: Lady Gaga
[Intro]
I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love
I'd kill for love, I'd kill for—
I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love
I'd kill for love
[Verse 1]
The moon is callin', all the bad boys come to play
You caught me howlin', there's a wolf inside of me
You know what I am, baby, and I know you're gonna be mine
B-be mine, uh
No wrong decisions, yeah, the mystery is mine
It's not a crime if there's nothing left behind
You know what I am, baby, and I know you're gonna be mine
B-be mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight I won't wear my disguise
I'm 'bout to take you by surprise
You'll be the start of my demise
I'd kill for you
You can't escape my grip tonight
I won't go home without a fight
Already whet my appetite
[Chorus]
I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love (I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love)
(I'd kill for love, I'd kill for—)
Kill for love, I'd kill for your love tonight
When you scream like an animal, I know I've got my hands tied
Love, I'd kill for love (I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love)
(I'd kill for love, I'd kill for—)
Kill for love, I'd kill for your love tonight
When it's twelve on the clock, you know I'm comin' for the wild life

[Verse 2]
Have no illusion, I'm a monster on the prowl
And I found my next bite, yeah, I'm looking at you now
I know what you are, baby, and I know you're gonna be mine
B-be mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight I won't wear my disguise
I'm 'bout to take you by surprise
You'll be the start of my demise
I'd kill for you
You can't escape my grip tonight
I won't go home without a fight
Already whet my appetite
[Chorus]
I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love (I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love)
(I'd kill for love, I'd kill for—)
Kill for love, I'd kill for your love tonight
When you scream like an animal, I know I've got my hands tied
Love, I'd kill for love (I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love)
(I'd kill for love, I'd kill for—)
Kill for love, I'd kill for your love tonight
When it's twelve on the clock, you know I'm comin' for the wild life
[Bridge]
Talk to me, tell me where you from
(Kill for love, kill for love)
On the hunt, I'll be your snack for fun
(Kill for love, kill for love)
What's your name? Oh, tell me where you're from
(Kill for love, kill for love)
On the hunt, I'll be your snack for fun
(Kill for love)

[Chorus]
I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love (I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love)
(I'd kill for love, I'd kill for—)
Kill for love, I'd kill for your love tonight
When you scream like an animal, I know I've got my hands tied
Love, I'd kill for love (I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love)
(I'd kill for love, I'd kill for—)
Kill for love, I'd kill for your love tonight
When it's twelve on the clock, you know I'm comin' for the wild life
[Outro]
Ooh
Come on
Woo
Kill for love, I'd kill for your love tonight
Kill for love, I'd kill for your love tonight
Kill for love, I'd kill for your love tonight
I'd kill for love, I'd kill for love
I'd kill for love, I'd kill for—
