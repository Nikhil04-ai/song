Title: Down
Artist: Doja Cat
Lyrics from Snippet
[Intro]
Pickin’ cherries, cream and peaches
Problems vary, it tastes sweeter when it goes down, down
[Chorus]
(Down, down, down, down) Down, down, down
(Down, down, down, down) Down, down
(Down, down, down, down) Down, down, down
(Down, down, down, down) Down, down
(Down, down, down, down)
(Down, down, down, down)
(Down, down, down, down)
(Down, down, down, down)
[Verse 1]
I got this thing about it
Oh boy I had to sing about it
They say this apple don’t fall far from the tree
Gotta tell me not to think about it, hey
