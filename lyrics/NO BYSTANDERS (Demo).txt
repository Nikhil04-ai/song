Title: NO BYSTANDERS (Demo)
Artist: Travis Scott 
[Intro: Juice WRLD]
The party never ends
In a motel laying with her friends
I'm tryna get revenge
You'll be all out of love in the end
[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Spent ten hours on this flight, man
Told the pilot ain't no flight plans
Can't believe whatever I'm seeing
And they know whenever I land
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Sheck Wes]
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Bitch!)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Bitch!)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Yeah)
[Post-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
The party never ends
In a motel laying with my sins, yeah
I'm tryna get revenge
You'll be all out of love in the end
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Bicentennial man, put the city on slam
She get trippy off Xans, lost 21 grams
And she did it on cam, wasn't no video dance
Make my own rules, I really don't pick, I just choose
I don't set picks, I just shoot
Chop and get screwed
I told her it's B.Y.O.B., that mean buy your own boobs
Put it on God, He the one who put me on top
Can't be put in a box, gotta move on the opps
Never got the move on the drop
Niggas tryna move on the Scott
And move that deep, tryna run down, shit's steep
Gotta act a fool with the squad
Next city, no sleep, back to the 713

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Spent ten hours on this flight, man
Told the pilot ain't no flight plans
Can't believe whatever I'm seeing
And they know whenever I land
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Sheck Wes]
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Bitch!)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Bitch!)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Heartbreak hotel
Bet you can't take no L's
Plug like AOL
Who say that I ain't gon' sell?
Hand me the H, I'll sell
She said "I got a nigga"
I said "I ain't gon' tell"
Buy it by the pound so it ain't no scale
I'm sick of the drank
The flippin' of paint
Grippin' the grain
Whipping the tank
My niggas gon' flame
Bitch, I'm with gang
Got your bitch on the plane

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Spent ten hours on this flight, man
Told the pilot ain't no flight plans
Can't believe whatever I'm seeing
And they know whenever I land
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Sheck Wes]
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Bitch!)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Bitch!)
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up (Yeah)
[Outro: Juice WRLD]
The party never ends
