Title: Beg for It
Artist: Dua Lipa
[Chorus]
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?
[Verse 1]
You cut the cord and you let me go
Clean break, so professional
When I mouth, I'm the last to know
Saying, “It's not me, it's you”
Textbook how you're actin' out
I knew you would come around
Tables turned, oh, it's funny how, baby
It's not me, it's you
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you're really, really comin' here for
Be a grown man, leave your ego at the door
Tell me what you're really, really comin' here for
What you gon' do for that la-la-la?
[Chorus]
You say you'rе ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, thеn beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?

[Verse 2]
How you likin' the way it feels?
My hand on the steering wheel
No, I never got ya so revealed
I play your game so well
Can't say that I blame ya now
If I was you, I'd be breaking down
Tables turned, got me laughing how
I play your game so well
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you're really, really comin' here for
Be a grown man, leave your ego at the door
Tell me what you're really, really comin' here for
What you gon' do for that la-la-la?
[Chorus]
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?

[Bridge]
You must take me for a fool
(Baby, get on your knees and beg me for it)
It's fun to mess with you
(Baby, get on your knees and beg me for it)
[Chorus]
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?
You say you're ready for it
Show me how much you want it
Hey, then beg me for it
What you gon' do for that la, la, la, la?
[Outro]
Yeah yeah (Uh-oh)
Yeah yeah (Uh-oh)
Yeah yeah (Uh-oh)
Yeah yeah (Uh-oh)
