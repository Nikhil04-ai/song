[Verse 1]
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause I'm the girl that they exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I wish I was someone else
I'm anxious, and no one can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more
