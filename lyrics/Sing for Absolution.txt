Title: Sing for Absolution
Artist: Muse
Â 
[Verse 1]
Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you, my beautiful
Tiptoe to your room (Tiptoe to your room)
A starlight in the gloom (A starlight in the gloom)
I only dream of you (I only dream of you)
And you never knew (And you never knew)
[Chorus]
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, ooh
[Verse 2]
There's nowhere left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside and will never die
Lips are turning blue (Lips are turning blue)
A kiss that can't renew (A kiss that can't renew)
I only dream of you (I only dream of you)
My beautiful (My beautiful)
[Chorus]
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, hey

[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, yeah
[Outro]
Our wrongs remain unrectified
And our souls won't be exhumed
