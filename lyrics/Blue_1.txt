Title: Blue
Artist: Ed Sheeran
[Verse 1]
Oh, it took a while to read the signs
But she used to be a friend of mine
Leadin' forward, but fell behind
Loneliness redefined
[Pre-Chorus]
Over and all of above, I hope for
Happiness is all you know, but
I can't help but holdin' on, on
[Chorus]
Silence is never golden
Quietly stuck in the moment, I'm not over you
I'll be forever lonely
Silence ain't golden, you know that it's only blue
[Post-Chorus]
Blue
It's only blue
Blue
[Verse 2]
Oh, I missed the mark a hundred times
Tried to take it back and change the night
Yeah, we used to set the dream alive
Till the day it sunk and slowly died

[Pre-Chorus]
Over and all of above, I hope for
Happiness is all you know, but
I can't help but holdin' on, on
[Chorus]
Silence is never golden
Quietly stuck in the moment, I'm not over you
And I'll be forever lonely
Silence ain't golden, you know that it's only blue
[Post-Chorus]
Blue
It's only blue
Blue
It's only blue
