[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love
Can a nigga get a-
Baby (baby!), love
Baby, baby (know that I need 'ya baby)
You're my love

Baby, baby (know that I will need 'ya baby)
You're my love (know that I will need 'ya baby)
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Late night, scrollin' through my call log
Had too much to drink, so I called ya
We been on and off for a long time
How 'bout I come to your job and just spend time?
Damn, goddamn
You always do it, damn, you get it at demand
Got me thumbin' through them bands
I thank your momma for your damn features
Yo' ass on Pam
I swear I ain't lyin', Gina
Thought that we would never talk again
'Cause you always call me up at the wrong time
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy & 
Travis Scott
]
Everybody love me, baby (
everybod
y lo

)
Can't nobody love me like you (
ooh-ooh-oooh
)
Everybody love you, baby (
oooh-oooh-oooh
)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott & 
James Fauntleroy
]
Baby, love, baby
 (
know I need you
), 
baby, you're my love
You always call me up at the wrong time (

)
I be up late, obeying no signs, no (
know that I need 'ya baby
)
Won't you come over an' just roll mine? (
yeah, baby
)
I'ma mix somethin' for the long drive home
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Wishin' I controlled time, wishin' I could do it
Wishin' for a long time just to set the mood in
We be goin' all night, but you just abusin'
Always had my phone line, but you never used it
Now you see me goin' up, now I'm glowin' up
I been, I been in that DB truck with my Courtney Love, ohh-oh
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy & 
Travis Scott
]
Everybody love me, baby (everybody love me, baby)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)
Can only be you, can only be you
Everybody love me, baby (everybody love me, baby)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)
[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love

Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love
Can a nigga get a-
