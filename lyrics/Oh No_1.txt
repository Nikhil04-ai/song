Every time I come around they like "Oh no"

'Cause ain't no checkin' me
You'll be respecting me until I leave this room or my gat'll go boom
Bullets go zoom

They pourin' out liquor with no room to consume, ya silly buffoon
I pop niggas like balloons, I ain't feelin' 'em
Walkin' in my 
big blue Chucks

[Chorus: 50 Cent & 
Snoop Dogg

Every time I come around they like "Oh no"
I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my fofo

I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco
No sense in coppin' pleas when you see my knife out (Knife out)
Motherfucker it's lights out (Lights out)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Ever since the moment I was born I been dyin'

Hundred miles an hour pulse flyin' wit my iron (Uh-huh)
He who fears fate lives like a coward
You go against me, you'll be devoured (Rrrrrrrrr)
That Nina get to poppin', 
you'll have change of heart
I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc usin' donors, dead niggas for spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snitch and the heart of dead narc
Niggas never see the light till spark
Then they bleed, it get cold
Then shit get dark (Uh-huh)
You can call me the beast from the east
I run these streets, you could eat hollow tip shells or you could work for me (Work for me)
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
Push me, a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin' (Woo!)
Your services are no longer needed, rock-a-bye baby
My bitch'll do it to you with a lil' .380 (Yeah)

[Chorus: 50 Cent & 
Snoop Dogg
]
Every time I come around they like "Oh no"
I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my fofo
Shit I been through in my hood made my heart cold
I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco
No sense in coppin' pleas when you see my knife out (Knife out)
Motherfucker it's lights out (Lights out)
Here come snoop, uh
 (Aw shit)
Oh no
Oh no
[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm bailin' through the door again, let momo pour again
Me and my ho again, yeah she got the .4 up in this motherfucker
And I'ma bust it if you try to rush us or touch us or sucka ducka us
It'll crack off
Now back off, real slow (Back up real slow)
And if you don't know, I never hesitate to shoot a ho
Yeah, that's my reputation, you test my patience and
You and your fam, bam, gon' hear the blam, blam (Blam, blam)
Goddammit I'm at it again
They don' let bitch nigga, up outta the pen
And now he lookin' for me, what the heck (What?)
My game is built on respect
Now I'm breathin' down your motherfuckin' neck
I dumps 'til my clip is empty
I'm headin' down Wilshire to San Vicente
And when I get there, don't ask who sent me
Just take dem shots and drop it like it's hot,
 bitch nigga

[Chorus: 50 Cent & 
Snoop Dogg
]
Every time I come around they like "Oh no"
I get to trippin' slap the clip up in my fofo
Shit I been through in my hood made my heart cold
I get to poppin' off that thang like I'm loco
No sense in coppin' pleas when you see my knife out (Knife out)
Motherfucker it's lights out (Lights out)
Here come snoop, uh
