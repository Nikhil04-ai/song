Title: CALI BITCH MENTALITY
Artist: Doja Cat
[Intro]
Oh my fucking God
I know I told her and she was like, "No, cause like, I'm the baddest bitch"
Are you serious?
Yeah, like
Don't even tell me that
I'm telling you that, girl
Yah
Oh, my fucking God
What a bitch!
[Hook]
Cali bitch mentality
Come through with formality
Fuck a bitch with split personalities
Stay real as fuck in reality
Da-da-da-da 
fatality
Power trippin', brutality
With a bad bitch who's a bad mix
She's like four different nationalities
 (Nationalities?)
[Verse 1]
Yuh, fuckin' the world and I might climax
Flyer than your girl, then she might hijack
She won't fight back but she'll bite my swag
Tryna ride like that and your eyesight track in the back
Of the club smokin' Li-Lilac
Bitches at the door when they find I'm back
Know I'm on tour and I'm quite high class
I'm outta sight, need an eyeglass
All up in my hair tryna bite my tracks
I'm so sick, circle ya bitch
Boy, let it spin, I'mma make you gag, gag

[Interlude]
Choking
[Hook]
Cause this that Cali' bitch mentality
It's that valley shit, stay mad at me, uh
This that Cali' bitch mentality
Valley shit, stay mad at me
Valley shit, they mad at me
Ugh, cause this that Cali' bitch mentality
Valley shit, stay mad at me
It's that valley bitch mentality
[Verse 2]
Motherfucker I'm pow with a bang
Come through, the coat real, down with the chain
I ride with them thangs, no coward exchange
Only bad bitches get a smile from the face so why would I change?
Cause I howled at the moon, growled at a goon
On the prowl for your moolah so hide what you make, yes
Five for the bitches and one for the fakes
Two to you niggas like deuces
Nigga, just lose it
If you want that, bet a bitch gon' move it
Either you grip that? Or you gon' flip that?
But I don't hang with a strap like nooses
Kill it then do it again like "Oops, bitch"
I'm not Britney, that don't mean I'm
Not sick sipping this Toxic
I don't give a fuck where a punk bitch block is
Let 'em be aware I'm a trending topic, watch it

[Hook]
Cuz this that Cali' bitch mentality
Valley shit, they mad at me
Cali' bitch mentality
Valley shit, stay mad at me
It's that Cali' bitch mentality
Valley shit, stay mad at me
Cali' shit, Cali' shit
In the valley bitch, stay mad at me
[Bridge]
Mad at-
Mad at me, ma-ma-ma-mad at me
Yuh, they mad at me, ma-ma-ma-mad at me
Mad at-
They mad at me, th-th-they mad at me
S-so stay mad at me
It's that Cali shit, mentality, yuh, hahaha
[Interlude]
Check this out, hahaha, yuh, yuh, check it
[Verse 3]
The valley, the valley, these cats is so bummy, I call 'em O'Malley (O'Malley?)
I ain't got no babies but treat my haters like my hubby they daddy (My hubby they daddy?)
I ain't gonna stop 'til my clique is on top and my whip is imported (Whip is imported, -ported)
New to the city, I cruise through the city like "Bitch, I'm important!" (Bitch, I'm important!)
