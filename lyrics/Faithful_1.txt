Title: Faithful
Artist: Justin Bieber
 
Finished Version
[Verse 1]
I'm close to finishing
I'm closely listening
I'm tryna figure out but this is not as interesting
Should I stay or go?
How do I let her know?
Don't wanna lose control
Think it's time to tell her that I'm moving on (I'm moving on)
I'm moving on
Not tryna make commitments (commitments)
Just tryna make decisions (decisions)
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm faithful
Faithful yeah
'Cause I'm faithful
I don't want to hurt your heart
But I told you from the start
'Cause I'm faithful
You know I'm faithful
[Verse 2]
Everyday you’re wondering
Asking me who was I with and where I been
Mind no more
'Cause baby I am leaving
You know that I'm moving on, moving on
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
You made a promise
Girl at least I'm honest

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm faithful
Faithful yeah
'Cause I'm faithful
I don't want to hurt your heart
But I told you from the start
'Cause I'm faithful
You know I'm faithful
[Verse 3]
It seems like every day you wanna fight
Why do you think I don't wanna spend the night
You always mess with me
Let me be
[Bridge]
I'm moving on slowly
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
You made a promise
Girl at least I'm honest
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I gave you everything I have, I have nothing to give
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm faithful (faithful, 'cause I'm faithful)
Faithful yeah
'Cause I'm faithful
I don't want to hurt your heart
But I told you from the start
'Cause I'm faithful
You know I'm faithful

But I told you from the start
Girl I'm faithful
You know I'm faithful
Everyday you’re wondering
Asking me who was I with and where I been
Write 'em all
'Cause baby I am leaving
Don't get it wrong 'cause I trust you and I love you and it's a new season

I'm moving on, I'm moving on
You made a promise
Girl at least I'm honest
'Cause I'm faithful
Faithful yeah

I don't want to hurt your heart
But I told you from the start
Girl I'm faithful
You know I'm faithful
Yeah
