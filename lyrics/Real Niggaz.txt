[Intro]
A-yeah!
Bad Boy in the house for the '95
Big shout out to my man Mel Smith
To my man Don Cee Shan in the house
What's up Michelle Ray, what's up boo?
[Verse 1]
Sick of mama screamin' that "Get a job, nigga"
Pressed to the limit, got to rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in the hooptie
Whispered in his ear, "This is what we got to do, G"
Got to bang a nigga and bang a nigga good
So I can cop a Benz and drive the fuck out the hood
'Cause baby-mama screamin', "Your daughter 12 months"
Can't live life slingin' rocks and smokin' blunts
Hangin' with the niggas don't pay the bills
And being broke at 30 give a nigga the chills
So what we gotta do is creep and see a sweet vic
Yo, you see that shit? (Hell yeah, I see that shit)
Colombian, Dominican, yeah whatever
Whoever he was, he had it tucked under the leather
Two keys, 20 Gs, nigga, please!
Blew his brains out 'cause witnesses, we don't leave
[Chorus]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things, ugh!
And the saga continues, uh

[Interlude: Radio Skit]
Radio check, back on the phones! I got a caller. Caller, your name?
Yo, this is Jam
Who?

DJ Jam?

Fuck you doing on the phone? Man, you supposed to be helping me do this Biggie thing...
Man, if JC can get up in here and do his, you know what I'm saying, lil' roll call, lil' thing, I know I can get up in here and introduce mine. You know what I'm saying?
Aight, yo
Can I run it down?
Yeah, aight
I'ma just let the record spin and this what I want you to play, right?
Aight!
You can hit me off with uh, first, with "Ready to Die."
Yeah
Come back with "One More Chance."
Mhm
Then you know you gotta hit that "The What" with the Mr. Mef, right?
Yeah
And then, since it is a "Everyday Struggle" out there, you can hit me with that joint, too
That's right. Now bring your ass back in this room and get back on them turntables
[Spoken]
Yeah, Bad Boy in the house
Blowing up the spot and all that
And all this paper, son
Keep it real, son
PR in the house
Nasim
Supa P Kelly Green represent to the fullest

[Verse 2]
After mad blunts and gin we had the plan made
I bought my wifey a crib, I bought the M.A.F.I.A. an arcade
Mad games: pool tables and candy
A little extra trickin' loot be comin' in handy
Check it, got on some '95 shit, 
sold the 5, bought the 6
Del Vec
, copped the Lex, we was set (ugh!)
Nino had work all in the projects
Niggas slingin' O's he kept the profit
No one could stop it
, we was living it up
All the sexy young bitches stressin', givin' it up
Same bitches suckin' dick, tryin' their best to thrill me
Said the niggas I killed is out to kill me
Soon as she spoke, on that note, I saw trenchcoats
One had a MAC spittin', all I saw was gunsmoke
The other had a shotty, I was shootin' everybody
And I wasn't missin', had to get out this position
Niggas still hittin', feeling hot ones in my back
Licked six shots, smoked the nigga with the MAC
The nigga with the shotty still bustin', cussin'
Maricóns and putas
, all I'm tryna do is shoot ya
Two shots in the Ruger, booyah! Blew his ass out
Then I passed out!
[Chorus]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things (ugh, ugh)

[Break]
And the saga continues
Bad Boy in the house, for the '95 piece
Real niggas, aight
[Interlude]
Yo check it
Call Lil Cease, tell that motherfucker to bring me some motherfucking weed to this hospital
Fuck that, tell Uncle Paulie to go pick up ten thousand from Dez and go take about 20 Gs from Nino
Tell that motherfucker to get this nigga next door up out of here, that nigga be snoring all night, I can't sleep
And call that big butt nurse with the long hair to come suck my dick, ugh!
[Verse 3]
The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
But the nurses is lovin' me
Sayin' the best part of the day is my half
Feedin' me breakfast and givin' me a sponge bath
Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga, I'm gettin' high, gettin' head on the beach
Chillin', sittin on about half a million
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion (
yeah
)
All for the love of drug dealing
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (
yeah
)
Any repercussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips
All the time, Big Poppa kick the raw rhyme (
yeah
)
Raw flows, and that's how it goes
[Chorus]
On the road to riches and diamond rings (
yeah
)
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things, ugh!
