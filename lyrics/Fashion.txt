Title: Fashion
Artist: David Bowie
Â 
[Verse 1]
There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here
[Pre-Chorus]
Fashion - Turn to the left
Fashion - Turn to the right
Ooh, fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep
[Guitar Solo 1]
[Chorus]
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me
No-Beep-Beep
[Verse 2]
There's a brand new talk but it's not very clear
Oh bop
That people from good homes are talking this year
Oh bop, fashion
It's loud and it's tasteless and I've heard it before
Oh bop
You shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor
(Ooh, bop, fashion)

[Chorus 2]
Fashion - Turn to the left
Fashion - Right
Fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep
[Guitar Solo 2]
[Chorus]
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me
No
-Beep-Beep - Beep-Beep
