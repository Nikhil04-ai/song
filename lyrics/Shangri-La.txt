Title: Shangri-La
Artist: Snoop Dogg
[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah
Shangri-La
La-la-la-la
Yeah
We 'bout to rewrite history in this motherfucker
Yeah, get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
With some monumental shit
[Verse: Snoop Dogg]
Good mornin', it's Mr. Broadus
The moment finally upon us
Daytona's still bendin' corners
Them tires burnin' them donuts
Dirty numbers for thirty summers
It's what it's meant to be, my appointment with destiny
Trials and tribulations was testin' me, shit was treachery
Niggas swear they high but look up and see my trajectory
To win is a necessity
, you niggas know my specialty
In here cookin' up the fuckin' recipe, don't question me
S-N-double O-P
, my name is the fuckin' equity
Nigga, never check for me unless you got a check for me
Fuck you, pay me, respectfully, especially
Melodies mixed with felonies, niggas, you know my legacy
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Top shelf shit, it's time to start some trouble
Yeah, you motherfuckin' right, I made a life out of this hustle
Now let it bubble
We back, sit back, relax and roll it up
Brainstormin' and I'm chainsmokin' and by
The same token, the changes remain a potent supply
No, this ain't no disguise, I'm blowin' dope to the sky, huh
Con Air, let it fly, tt
Say hi to my alibi (Haha)
Just another ghetto lullaby

[Outro: Stalone]
Now that we have your undivided attention
This disclaimer's designed to warn the sensitive
If you're easily offended, pussy, don't worry
No one wants to fuck you
Therefore, find your exits to your left and to your right
And to the rest of you that love switching positions
Let's do it missionary
