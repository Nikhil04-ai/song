Title: Woman In Love
Artist: Bee Gees
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But i give you it all
I am a woman in love
And i'd do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right i defend
Over and over again
What do i do ?
With you eternally mine
In love there is no measure of time
They planned it all at the start
That you and i live in each others heart

We may be oceans away
You feel my love
I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall
But i give you it all
I am a woman in love
And i'd do anything
To get you into my world
And keep you within
It's a right i defend
Over and over again
What do i do ?
I am a woman in love
And i'm talkin' to you
I know how you feel
What a woman can do
It's a right i defend
Over and over again
I am a woman in love
And i'd do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right i defend
Over and over again
What do i do ?
