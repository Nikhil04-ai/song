[Verse 1]
Get out the way, mister
With your short sharp tips
No, I won't read your lips right now
And baby, hey
You send a shiver down my spine
But do you read my mind
Do you?
And you're looking pretty suspicious
And probably planning a heist
He's wanting to go to the strippers
It makes him feel all nice
[Chorus]
(Cigarette smoke yeah)
The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and
(Smacking a bloke yeah)
Smacking a bloke here tonight
[Verse 2]
Get out my way, mister
With your short sharp tips
No, I won't read your lips right now
And baby, hey
You send a shiver down my spine
But do you read my mind
Do you?
He's probably got stopped by a panda
For speeding on his way there
Flashing of digital cameras
From tourists in Trafalgar Square

[Chorus]
(Cigarette smoke yeah)
The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and
(Snortin' some coke yeah)
Snortin' some coke off her thighs
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
[Outro]
(Cigarette smoke yeah)
The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and
(Smacking a bloke yeah)
Smacking a bloke here tonight
And I just can't see for the
(Cigarette smoke yeah)
The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and
(Snortin' some coke yeah)
Snortin' some coke off her thighs
Lalalalalala laaaaaaaoooo
Owww
