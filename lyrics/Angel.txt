Artist: Lionel Richce
[Verse 1]
I just want to tell you all the things you are
And all the things you mean to me
When I find myself believing there's no place to go
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart
[Chorus]
You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need to know
Tonight...
[Verse 2]
Life is just a moment, we're blowing in the wind
We're trying to find a friend
And only time can tell us if we win or if we lose
And who will stand beside us
When there's darkness all around me, you're the light I see
When I need someone to ease my troubled mind
[Chorus]
You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need to know
Oh, tonight

Oh, you're my angel, aha
All I need tonight
You're my angel (my angel)
[Chorus]
You're the answer to my prayer
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel, my miracle
You're all I need to know
Tonight (tonight)
You're all I need tonight
All I need tonight
(Angel, my angel, my angel)
You're all I need to know
(Angel, my angel, my angel)
Oh, you're my angel
(Angel, my angel, my angel)
My angel, my, my, my, my, my angel
(Angel, my angel, my angel)
My angel, my angel
