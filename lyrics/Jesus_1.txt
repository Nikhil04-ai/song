Title: Jesus
Artist: Queen
[Verse 1]
And then I saw Him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered 'round Him
The beggars shouted, the lepers called Him
The old man said nothing, he just stared about Him
[Chorus]
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus (Going down)
All going down
[Verse 2]
Then came a man before his feet he fell
Unclean, said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now, go now, you're a new man instead
[Chorus]
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus (Right)
All going down
[Verse 3]
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star, took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man

[Chorus]
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus (Going down to Bethlehem)
All going down
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star, took them to Bethlehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was a leader of man, that's right
[Chorus]
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
