Title: Dust My Broom
Artist: Etta James
Dust my broom
From inside my room
Dust my broom
From inside my room
If we never leave, girl what're we to do
Dust my broom
From inside my room
You can dust my broom
When you can dust my tomb
I'll never leave this place i've got now
Baby don't, baby don't you go
Baby don't you, baby don't you go
