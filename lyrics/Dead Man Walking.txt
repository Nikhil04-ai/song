Title: Dead Man Walking
Artist: David Bowie
[Verse 1]
He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise?
As I walk down the aisle?
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone
(Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality)
Now I'm older than movies
(Dance my way, falling up through the years)
Let me dance away
[Till I swivel back ‘round, then I fly, fly, fly)
Now I'm wiser than dreams
(Losing breath underwater, well, I'm gone, gone, gone)
Let me fly, fly, fly
(Spin slack through reality)
While I'm touching tomorrow
(Dance my way, falling up through the years)
And I know who's there
[Till I swivel back ‘round, then I fly, fly, fly)
(Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone)
When silhouettes fall
(Spinning slack through reality)

[Chorus]
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
[Refrain]
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking, oh ho
[Verse 2]
Three old men dancing under the lamp lights
Shaking their sex and the bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked anew
Like a bad-tempered child
On the rain-slicked streets
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone
(Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality)
Now I'm older than movies
(Dance my way, falling up through the years)
Let me dance away
[Till I swivel back ‘round, then I fly, fly, fly)
Now I'm wiser than dreams
(Losing breath underwater, well, I'm gone, gone, gone)
Let me fly, fly, fly
(Spin slack through reality)
While I'm touching tomorrow
(Dance my way, falling up through the years)
And I know who's there
[Till I swivel back ‘round, then I fly, fly, fly)
(Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone)
When silhouettes fall
(Spinning slack through reality]

And I'm gone
[Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality]
[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
[Till I swivel back ‘round, then I fly, fly, fly]
[Losing breath underwater, well, I'm gone, gone, gone]
[Spin slack through reality)
(Dance my way, falling up through the years]
[Till I swivel back ‘round, then I fly, fly, fly]
[Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone]
[Spinning slack through reality]
[Chorus]
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
[Refrain]
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gone, gone, gone
[Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality]
[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
Let me dance, dance, dance
[Till I swivel back ‘round, then I fly, fly, fly]
[Losing breath underwater, well, I'm gone, gone, gone]
And I'm gone
[Spinning slack through reality]
[Dance my way, falling up through the years]
[Till I swivel back ‘round, then I fly, fly, fly]
Let me dance, dance, dance
[Losing breath underwater, well, I'm gone, gone, gone]
[Spin slack through reality]

[Chorus]
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
[Refrain]
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
