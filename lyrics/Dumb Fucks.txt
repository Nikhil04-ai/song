Title: Dumb Fucks
Artist: Crush
[Chorus]
I've been jumped, I've been dumped
I've been slumped on the curb
Still dipping around the corner screaming "fuck what ya heard"
In my black Cadillac and my all gold Glock
Flip flops bumping Gucci, I will never be stopped
Fuck the cops like it's 1988
While ya Momma wanna take me on a date
If it ain't about no money, I cannot associate
With no lame ass rappers, get the fuck up out my face
[Verse 1]
I'm an underground legend when I rise above the surface
You can tell by the massive pit stains
Under my arms that i've been working
Yo bitch lurking on my IG
Sliding through that DM
Can't pretend, I wonder my defence, got hoes in the sequence
Sometimes I be thinking why these women be drinking like no tomorrow
When you wake up in the morning, I bet you gon' feel the sorrows of today
Donâ€™t play with me, my AK gon' spray right were you lay
[Chorus]
I've been jumped, I've been dumped
I've been slumped on the curb
Still dipping around the corner screaming "fuck what ya heard"
In my black Cadillac and my all gold Glock
Flip flops bumping Gucci, I will never be stopped
Fuck the cops like it's 1988
While ya Momma wanna take me on a date
If it ain't about no money, I cannot associate
With no lame ass rappers, get the fuck up out my face

[Verse 2]
All these daps in my hands, now smiles in my face
Money, drugs, pussy, love, fake as fuck
Where do ya'll go when the curtain's closed?
I drop the mic, the crowd flows like Moses
I told you 'bout that foldger when you wake up
My nose is intact I won't take no pay cut
Matter fact you pay up
I know what's going on can't get involved no
I refuse to have a boss
The Underground Underdog is taking off
[Chorus]
I've been jumped, I've been dumped
I've been slumped on the curb
Still dipping around the corner screaming "fuck what ya heard"
In my black Cadillac and my all gold Glock
Flip flops bumping Gucci, I will never be stopped
Fuck the cops like it's 1988
While ya Momma wanna take me on a date
If it ain't about no money, I cannot associate
With no lame ass rappers, get the fuck up out my face
