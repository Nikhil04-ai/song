Title: Diamonds (Acoustic)
Artist: Sam Smith
[Verse 1]
Have it all, rip our memories off the wall
All the special things I bought
They mean nothing to me anymore
But to you, they were everything we were
They meant more than every word
Now I know just what you love me for
[Pre-Chorus]
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care
You dream of glitter and gold
My heart's already been sold
Show you how little I care
How little I care, how little I care
[Chorus]
My diamonds leave with you
You’re never gonna hear my heart break
Never gonna move in dark ways
Baby, you're so cruel
My diamonds leave with you
Material love won't fool me
When you’re not here, I can't breathe
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you

[Verse 2]
Shake it off, shake the fear of feeling lost
Always me that pays the cost
I should never trust so easily
You lied to me, lied to me
Then left with my heart 'round your chest
[Pre-Chorus]
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care
You dream of glitter and gold
My heart's already been sold
Show you how little I care
How little I care, how little I care
[Chorus]
My diamonds leave with you
You're never gonna hear my heart break
Never gonna move in dark ways
Baby, you're so cruel
My diamonds leave with you
Material love won't fool me
When you're not here, I can’t breathe
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Always knew
My diamonds leave with you
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Always knew
My diamonds leave with you
[Bridge]
You’re never gonna hear my heart break
Never gonna move in dark ways
Baby, you're so cruel
My diamonds leave with you
Material love won’t fool me
When you're not here, I can't breathe
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you
