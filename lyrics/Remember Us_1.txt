Title: Remember Us
Artist: John Legend
[Intro: John Legend]
Oh, I remember this
Ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: John Legend]
Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream
Where we talk, touch, and each word leads
Back to love that's evergreen
At least that's how it used to seem
[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, I remember this
Yeah, I remember this
Some days, I sit and reminisce
Do you?
[Verse 2: John Legend]
I'm a patient man, but in these times
Where we can't dance or compromise
I miss your laugh, I miss your eyes
They're still there in the back of my mind
[Chorus: John Legend]
I remember this
Yeah, I remember this
Some days, I sit and reminisce
Oh, do you?

[Refrain: John Legend]
Ooh, we loved without borders
Ooh, we broke all rules
Ooh, but gravity caught us
Oh, let's go back to the moon
[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, I remember this
Yeah, I remember this
Some days, I sit and reminisce
Oh, do you?
[Verse 3: John Legend]
Sometimes love can be like this
Sometimes life turns and twists
Through every hit and every miss
You're the one I can't forget
[Chorus: John Legend]
I still remember this
Hold on to every kiss
Some days I sit and reminisce
Oh, do you?
[Refrain: John Legend]
Ooh, we loved without borders
Ooh, we broke all the rules
Ooh, but gravity caught us
Oh, let's go back to the moon

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, I remember this
Yeah, I remember this
Some days, I sit and reminisce
Oh, do you?
[Verse 4: John Legend]
Oh, we melted the winter
Oh, we tasted the fall
Oh, but sweet turned to bitter
Oh, like there's no season at all
[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, I remember this
Say you remember this
Oh, I remember us
Do you?
[Post-Chorus: John Legend]
(Do you, do you, do you?)
Do you remember us?
(Do you, do you, do you?)
Oh baby
(Do you, do you, do you?)
I remember us

[Verse 5: Rapsody & 
John Legend
]
Yeah
Yeah
I remember you and I was like lightning and thunder (Lightning and thunder)
Remember that night you met my daddy and mama (Daddy and mama)
Got drunk for the first time, we laughed all summer
Laughed at Martin, we starved, it was part of the come up
Actin' juvenile to Juvenile, backin' it up
Actin' a nut in the Acura, the number one stunna (
Oh yeah, yeah
)
I remember you the same
You made me laugh 'til we cried
Had knots in our stomachs
You remember parties, nights up at the skating rink? (
Oh
)
Goin' crazy, watchin' Kobe win another ring (
Goin' crazy
)
We would argue, kiss and make up, then fall asleep (
Yeah
)
You went to church with me, singing Kingdom Melodies (
Woah, oh
)
Uh, date nights watchin' old movies (Watchin' old movies)
Halloween, I was Kim, you was B.I.G. in Coogi (You was B.I.G.)
I remember how you laughed when I tripped and fall
Give you the side-eye like, "Baby, that ain't funny at all" (
Yeah
)
Then I crack up (Hahaha)
You and I, you know we always had to act up (Yeah)
Let's back up
My mama didn't like it when we shacked up (
Oh
, yeah)
You packed up
Remember love takes practice (
Yeah
)
Shootin' in the gym like Kobe and Shaq was (Yes we did)
That's a fact, bruh
Yeah, I remember what Nip said (What?)
Ten toes down, you hit me up? "Hey big head"
I miss your visits (I miss you, I really, really miss you)
I still remember your home phone digits
'Cause I could always call on you (Call on you)
And I hope you remember me too, love (
Oh, oh
)
And I hope you remember me too
(
Oh, I remember us
)
[Outro: John Legend]
Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream
(Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream)
Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream
(Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream)
Don't wake me, don't wake me
Oh no, baby, uh
Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream
(Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream)
Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream
(Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream)
Oh, baby, uh
I want to remember us
Oh, do you?
