Title: Get Away
Artist: J.Cole
This track samples Billy Stewart -“Cross My Heart”

Cole raps about how life is stressing, but he still manages to keep a chill mindset and good approach towards it.
[Intro: J Cole]
LA, NC, NY, the Chi
Yeah, hey, yeah
[Verse 1: J Cole]
I wake up, hop out the shower, spray cologne on while I'm dressin'
They hollering 'bout recession so my niggas out here stressin'
But, bitch, I'm live and breathin', so to me, that there's a blessin'
See life is like a test that I ain't never got no F in
Steppin' out today
I gotta leave the crib, mama stressin' out, I pray
That ain't nobody gon' pull the weapon out and spray
'Cause I don't got no strap
And ever since we hit depression, niggas don't know how to act, in fact
There goes some niggas there, hatin', I feel the stare
Me verse you shinin', that's like a diamond and silverware
Let y'all feel the glare, I gotta go now
I'm ridin' through the city with the windows rolled down, shorty hollered
So I pulled up beside her, I'm frontin', "What's your name?"
She told me, "Boy, you know me, don't play no games
Now, look, they say you're blowin' up, hey, is it true?" Fired up
I say, "Girl, they wasn't kiddin' like they tubes tied up"
[Chorus]
I'm hollerin', "Hey"
Good God, what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressin' over shit they gotta pay
Ayy, tell me what's work without play?
All my niggas hollerin', "Hey"
Good God, what a day
Hey, baby girl, tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollerin' 'bout the problems of the world
It's just me and my favorite girl
Now all around, they holler

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Okay, so word been spreadin'
That I done jetted to New York, I was up there doin' my thing
So now, some folks I used to know is hollerin' out, "J. Cole"
I gotta chuckle 'cause I know they used to say Jermaine, so who changed?
What's in a name, though, when niggas can't hang on your shoestrings?
The flow insane, plus I got that flamethrow, that Liu Kang
Even in the winter, we bring feelings of summer, Suzanne
We get them hooked like T-Pain
, 
and scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me? I'm just a boy straight out the Ville
These wanksta-ass niggas gettin' played out for real
You actin' like you trill, nigga, you bet' not
You talkin' out your ass, you finna get your head rocked
This is where they shootin' sideways, 
boys gettin' blazed
Can't afford to fly, so we get high to get away
Now come here, ladies, see we tryna get you loose, pour it up
Take this juice, we gon' mix it with this Goose, don't throw it up
[Chorus]
I'm hollerin', "Hey"
Good God, what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressin' over shit they gotta pay
Ayy, tell me what's work without play?
All my niggas hollerin', "Hey"
Good God, what a day
Hey, baby girl, tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollerin' 'bout the problems of the world
It's just me and my favorite girl
Now all around, they holler

[Outro]
Yeah
Hey
Yeah
Hey
Yeah
