Artist: Ariana Grande
[Intro]
(Harvard's)
[Verse 1]
Oh darlin', I've been in and out of town
I've been missin' you around
Won't you come and see me now?
Oh darlin', I've been missing your lips
Miss your hands on my hips
Wanna tell you what I miss
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna kiss you, wanna kiss you, but I can't though
So I'ma look at you, look at you on a camera
And even though I know you can't blow out the candle
I wanna celebrate your birthday with no cake but I still love you like
[Chorus]
Ooh, my computer can't do all the things I want you to
I only want you
Ain't nobody in this town
That can come and put it down, put it down like you
Wish you could come and see me
T-T-Tell me that you need me
Just like I need you
And make me go "Oh, oh"
('Cause I love you, like)

[Verse 2]
Oh darlin', I've been working too much
I've been thinking 'bout your touch
T-Turn it on and hit me up
And I want ya
I wanna kiss you, wanna see you
Wanna tell you that I need you
Let me show you that I need you
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna kiss you, wanna kiss you, but I can't though
So I'ma look at you, look at you on a camera
And even though I know you can't blow out the candle
I wanna celebrate your birthday with no cake but I still love you like
[Chorus]
Ooh, my computer can't do all the things I want you to
I only want you
Ain't nobody in this town
That can come and put it down, put it down like you
Wish you could come and see me
T-T-Tell me that you need me
Just like I need you
And make me go "Oh, oh"
('Cause I love you, like)

[Outro]
Uh, huh
Uh, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
