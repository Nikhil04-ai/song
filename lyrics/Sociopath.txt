Title: Sociopath
Artist: Pusha T
 
[Refrain: Pusha T]
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot (D-D-D-ing up)
She AP and really eat a nigga's watch (D-ing up the spot)
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot
[Verse 1: Pusha T & 
Kanye West
]
She keep a lit 16, a network of typers
Fuck sellin' the pipers to get the baby the diapers
Call the bitch Swiffer 'cause all she know is swipers
Fuck a rap nigga, but she don't need him to wife her
(D-D-D-ing up the spot)
Benz trucker, all your mans want to fuck her
She get a nigga cleaned up too, you need a buffer?
Travel out to them islands in Thailand
She don't know if it's Lanvin or Lanvin
All she know, if it's my hands, it's pie hands
All she want is the monograms and my bands
Charcuteries
(
Yo, what, what is charcuteries?
)
(Man, it's, it's when you go to your hotel room)
(And they got the cheese and the fucking pepperoni)
(Sliced on a little wood board, waiting on you)
New jewelries
New taste levels, shit, she be schooling me (Nigga)

[Chorus: Pusha T]
I got a bitch that'll master your card
Nice with the Visas, passports is art
Every page inked up, her and the bitches link up
They think they hear the drum and the machine when it syncs up
Heads boppin', boop-bopty-boop-bop
Who you think showed you that Chanel did the tube socks?
Bustin' down watches
Rental whips in the garages
She don't trick, but she charges
[Verse 2: Pusha T & 
Kash Doll
]
Lotta double Cs, double Gs (
You know how I do it
)
New body parts, they double Ds (
You know how I do it
)
The dual exhaust is double Vs (
You know how I do it
)
You niggas talk, she fuckin' me
Her mother sayin' she should be a nurse hurts
But she just worry 'bout who got the purse first
I tried to tell her, "Go to real estate school"
She say, "
Don't you see these fucking dealer plates, fool?
You know the rush it is to know bitches hate you
'Cause they man is locked up but still laced you?
And you know I need it twice, so it takes two
Fendi cross-body, fanny pack beige blue
 (Nigga)
[Chorus: Pusha T]
I got a bitch that'll master your card
Nice with the Visas, passports is art
Every page inked up, her and the bitches link up
They think they hear the drum and the machine when it syncs up
Heads boppin', boop-bopty-boop-bop
Who you think showed you that Chanel did the tube socks?
Bustin' down watches
Rental whips in the garages
She don't trick but she charges

[Refrain: Pusha T]
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot (D-D-D-ing up–)
She AP and really eat a nigga's watch (D-ing up the spot)
My bitch hot like she D-ing up the spot (D-D)
